This is the Star Trek Classic List of Lists. It contains a listing of all the 
episodes and notes for the original and animated Star Trek TV series, plus
added notes for the first six Star Trek movies that feature the cast of the
original Star Trek series. These list of lists will be updated from time to
time. Other list of lists available include:

   * Star Trek: The Next Generation List of Lists
   * Star Trek: Deep Space Nine List of Lists
   * Star Trek: Voyager List of Lists
   * Babylon 5 List of Lists
   * Quantum Leap List Of Lists
   * Reno List of Lists
   * Las Vegas List of Lists

Due to previous problems, no print copies will be made available.

If you are wondering why I compile these lists, it is strictly out of the 
enjoyment of Star Trek, and the wealth of information from fellow fans who 
post on the electronic networks. (And they're still growing). The only payment 
I ask is thanks and contributions. I am not making a dime off these 
compilations.

Did you know: In PDP-11 assembly language, there was a set of instructions 
that were specifically implemented for making linked lists. A linked list is a 
list that points to either another list or a piece of data. In the instruction 
manuals I read, these were referred to as "lists of lists" (unless, of course, 
the linked list pointed only to data). (Thanks to Paul Hoffman)

Episode synopsis by Edward Champion.

First Season (29 Episodes)
-========================-
The pilot episode, The Cage, was made as the first Star Trek pilot, which was
seen originally by NBC executives. They rejected that pilot, but asked for a
second pilot to be made (Where No Man Has Gone Before). Later on, in the first
season, production delays required that, in one week's time, two episodes had
to be made. Thus, The Cage was edited and made a part of The Menagerie. Only a
black and white work print existed of scenes not used in The Menagerie. In
1986, it was released by Paramount Home Video as it was releasing the entire
original Star Trek series on videocassette, which combined all related color
footage from The Menagerie and filled in all of the gaps with the black and
white print. (As a bonus, the tape included an introduction by Gene
Roddenberry). In 1988, as a filler episode for Star Trek: The Next Generation
due to a writer's strike, Paramount aired The Cage, with the black and white
portions colorized, as part of a two-hour program From One Generation To The
Next, which aired between October 3 and October 9. (Segments also included a
sneak peek at Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, the introduction of Diana
Muldaur as Dr. Pulaski, and scenes from the upcoming second season). The
full-color Cage was released on home video to replace the hybrid B&W/Color
copy, but without the Roddenberry introductions.

The first season aired on NBC on Thursday nights at 8:30 PM, under Desilu
Studios.

third season by NBC.

Pictures - A Gulf+Western Company bought out Desilu Studios, and thus, the
third season was produced by Paramount.

Syndication Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
United States
-===========-
Broadcast (1/19/97)
-+++++++-
Star Trek is distributed to local stations by Paramount. It has been edited
down in order to fit in more commercials, and is aired according to
production code order, not according to original air dates. This, however,
will end at the end of 1997. Beginning on January 1st, 1998, the Sci-Fi
Channel purchased the exclusive rights to air "Star Trek", and rumor has it
that the channel will air the series uncut.

Video Tape (1/19/97)
-++++++++-
The entire series is also available uncut from Paramount Home Video, and
includes the original promos for the following episode. The ordering of the
tapes is according to production numbers, with "The Cage" considered to be
episode one.

You can also collect the entire series through Columbia House home video.

Laser Disc
-++++++++-
All 79 episodes, along with the pilot, are available from Paramount. They
are packaged 2 to a disc, not in numerical order. If you want specific
titles, catalog numbers, etc. "The Laser Video File" offers a complete
listing, or they are available in electronic form from the Barr LD data
base. The complete set of the animated series episodes is also available in
a boxed LD set. Only the recent all-color release of The Cage has digital
sound. Some of my discs were made by PVI in the US; some by PVC in Japan.
The PVC ones are mostly in the second and third seasons, and tend to have
fewer defects. Many don't even have CX, although some (mostly the later/PVC
ones) do. The original TV trailers are enclosed. At least one of the
trailers contains slightly different composition from the actual episode.
On the positive side, the colors are significantly more saturated than the
broadcasts.

Australia
-=======-
Both the original series and the animated series are shown on Channel 7,
which has perpetual rights to the series.

England/United Kingdom
-====================-
The BBC is currently showing the original series Wednesdays at 6 PM, but is
often pre-empted for sport coverage. Miri was shown only once, and it's
airing caused a lot of mail from angry parents that the BBC decided to
preview episodes before airing them. Whom Gods Destroy, The Empath, and
Plato's Stepchildren were never shown in the UK, as they were deemed
unsuitable for children.

France (1/8/97)
-====-
The series is titled Star Trek, but, as the contributor, Nicolas Catard,
pointed out, is one of the worst translated series. Terms were oftens
changed from episode to episode, and sometimes, voices would come from the
wrong areas of the ship, such as McCoy's voice, through the ships comm
systems, would be coming from Engineering, while McCoy was actually in
sickbay!

Broadcast
-+++++++-
Star Trek was first aired on TF1, first french chanel, in 1982, but it only
lasted a few episodes. In 1987, a new chanel, "La 5", started with a lot of
US series, including the original Star Trek. They broadcasted the whole 79
episodes serie until 1991, when the channel disappeared. Since then, the
series is shown on Canal Jimmy, a cable channel.

Video Tape
-++++++++-
UK imports are sold in France. In addition, 6 video tapes pack were
released including some of the best episodes (3 episode on each video
tape).

Germany (1/19/97)
-=====-
The series is titled "Raumschiff Enterprise", which, translated, means
"Starship Enterprise". It started airing on May 27th, 1972 with the episode
Tomorrow is Yesterday on the German Public Network ZDF, and, after not
being aired for several years, the series began it's current run on July 1,
1993. Part of the name change is because it would give the German viewer
the idea of a western series in space, while the literal translation, "Zug
zu den Sternen", would have suggested a documentary. The episode, Patterns
Of Force was not aired until September 8th, 1996 in Germany on Sat.1 due to
its Nazi theme. Incidentally, all references to the "Warp Drive" was
changed to a "SOL drive" in ZDF version. However, the rights is now owned
by Sat.1 (a private network), and Warp drives are now referred to as Warp
Drives.

Major Repeating Threads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Attempts at Self-Destruct
-=======================-
51. By Any Other Name -

70. Let That Be Your Last Battlefield -

"I'm a Doctor, not a _________"...
-================================-
Bricklayer - "Devil In The Dark"

Engineer - "Mirror, Mirror"

Mechanic - "The Doomsday Machine"

Escalator - "Friday's Child"

Coal Miner - "The Empath" (Seconds later, McCoy also says "I'm not a
mechanic."

...And Variations Thereof
-=======================-
"What am I, a doctor or a Moon shuttle conductor?" - "The Corbomite
Maneuver"

"I'm a scientist, not a military man." - Mr. Jaeger, "The Squire of Gothos"

"I don't know. I'm a doctor. If I were an officer of the line, I'd" -
McCoy, "A Taste of Armageddon"

"What do you mean? I'm a Doctor" - McCoy, "This Side of Paradise"

"I'm a soldier, not a diplomat." - Kirk, "Errand Of Mercy"

"I'm a surgeon, not a psychiatrist." - "The City On The Edge Of Forever"

"Well, are you a doctor or aren't you?" - Kirk, "Amok Time"

"I'm not a magician, I'm just an old country doctor." - "The Deadly Years"

These lines may have originated with Robert Heinlein's 1952 novel The
Rolling Stones. In that book, Dr. Edith Stone says, "How can I be sure? I'm
a doctor, not a fortune-teller." Also, there was a 1933 film called The
Kennel Club Murder Case starring William Powell as Philo Vance, who was a
popular book/movie detective back then. In this film, there was a Doctor
Finnegan, who made the comments "I'm a doctor, not a magician!", and "I'm a
doctor, not a detective!"

Leaving the Galaxy
-================-
The Enterprise leaves the galaxy in the following episodes:

3. Where No Man Has Gone Before -

51. By Any Other Name -

60. Is There In Truth No Beauty -

The Many Loves of James T. Kirk

3. Where No Man Has Gone Before - Kirk is infatuated with a blond lab
technician, and says that he almost married her.

6. Mudd's Women - Kirk was attracted, although short-lived and artificial,
to Eve McHuron, but no formal romance is established.

7. What Are Little Girls Made Of? - Kirk meets Andrea, an android built by
the Exoites. Her relationship was Kirk was purely artificial and for
ulterior reasons by Roger Korby. She was later destroyed.

8. Miri - Miri becomes infatuated with Kirk, who remained on "Earth." It
was Spock and McCoy who had to open his eyes to the fact that she was
"becoming a young woman," and even then, Kirk showed more romantic interest
in Rand than he ever did in Miri.

9. Dagger Of The Mind - Kirk had a previous encounter with Dr. Helen Noel
at a science lab Christmas party, and was reminded of it when they visited
the Tantalus colony with her as Kirk's unexpected assistant. Kirk's
feelings of attraction to her were artificially swelled by Dr. Adams'
Neural Neutralizer.

13. Conscience Of The King - Kirk forges, somewhat blatantly, a
relationship with Lenore Karidian, the daughter of Anton Karidian (also
known as Governor Kodos of Tarsus IV), in order to find out more about
Karidian. However, later, Kirk was developing some level of a more sincere
feelings for her. However, at the end of the episode, Lenore goes insane.

15. Shore Leave - Ruth is reincarnated as an old flame of Kirk while he was
at the Academy. However, she is seen as an artificial construct on the
caretaker's world.

20. Court Martial - Kirk refers to an old fling with JAG officer Areel Shaw
during court martial proceedings.

28. City On The Edge Of Forever - Kirk gets romantically involved and falls
in love Edith Keeler while in Earth's past to find McCoy. However, he was
forced to let Edith be killed by an automobile accident in order to get
history right.

33. Mirror, Mirror - Kirk becomes romantically involved with Marlena Moreau
on the mirror Enterprise.

41. The Deadly Years - Although there was no real relationship offered
between Kirk and Dr. Janet Wallace, a past romance was very definitely
referred to. Kirk was simply dedicated to his ship, and Dr. Wallace was
dedicated to her science.

48. A Private Little War - Nona was an artificial relationship brought
about by the drugs and charms of the mystic wife of Kirk's friend Tyree on
the planet Neural. When Nona is killed while betraying her tribe, Kirk does
not shed a tear.

45. The Gamesters of Triskelion - Kirk gets involved with Shahna, a fellow
"thrall", while in captivity on the planet Triskelion. And, as an example
of Kirk being his stereotypical worst, he succeeds in convincing Shahna
that personal freedom, idealism, and kissing is the way to love before
leaving her (voluntarily) behind on Triskelion.

51. By Any Other Name - Kirk seduces Kelinda in an attempt to expose the
"weaknesses" of the Kelvans now that they have assumed human form. Kelinda
later settled with Rojan.

54. Bread and Circuses - Claudius Marcus, wanting to give Kirk a few last
moments "as a man", has Kirk doing a one-nighter with Drusilla, Claudius's
personal slave.

58. The Paradise Syndrone - Kirk, when he lost his memories, has a romance
with Miramanee. In this case, Kirk was totally dedicated, sincere, and
willing to settle down and be a family man in the Native American style. Of
course, once Kirk regains his memories, this side of Kirk goes away.
Miramanee was later killed.

66. Wink Of An Eye - This was a rather amusing, and probably a little
ridiculous, romance between Kirk and Deela, a member of the accelerated
Scalosian society. Deela, however, stays behind on Scalos.

68. Elaan of Troyius - Kirk was infatuated with Elaan of Elas, mainly due
to the intoxicating effects of the chemical composition of Elann's tears.
While Elann married the ruler of Troyius, Kirk gets over the intoxication
by remembering that his first love is the Enterprise.

71. The Mark Of Gideon - Kirk is romancing Odona instead of interrogating
her as to why the entire Enterprise crew has disappeared. Odona's purpose
was to contact the potentially fatal disease Vegan Choriomengitis in order
to reduce some of her planet's overpopulation.

74. Requiem For Methuselah - While visiting Holberg 917-G and investigating
Flint, he has a romance with Rayna Kapec. Kirk soon discovers that Rayna
was an android built to be the "perfect woman" by Flint, and when both
Flint and Kirk fight over Rayna, she short-circuits, being unable to deal
with the intensity of her emotions for both men. Kirk, later, is allowed to
forget the pain associated with the incident with Spock's mind melding
help.

79. Turnabout Intruder - Dr. Janice Lester was another old relationship of
Kirk's that was doomed to end because of Lester's domineering resentment of
Kirk's superior capabilities as a starship Captain. Dr. Lester uses a
device on Camus II to switch bodies with an unwilling Kirk. She later goes
insane.

Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan - Dr. Carol Marcus was an old, serious
romance of Kirk's. He finds out that he had a son, David. This was an
relationship on Kirk's part, and his love for his ship and her love for her
work would never allow them to be happy together. She continued on her
scientific career.

Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home - While on 20th century Earth, Kirk has a
subdued, intellectual romance with Dr. Gillian Taylor, a cetacean
biologist. However, once back in the 23rd century, they go their separate
ways.

Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country - Kirk is seduced by Martia, but
only to escape from the Klingon Mine/Prison. However, Kirk sees through
Martia's deception, and Martia is later killed by the Klingons.

order to beam back up to the Enterprise....

Did you know...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
...Nichelle Nichols was planning to leave Star Trek at the end of the first
season, but was persuaded to stay by Martin Luther King, Jr.?

...The Enterprise model is 11 feet in length, and weighs 200 pounds. The
model is composed of plastic, wood, and rolled steel. The cost of
materials, in 1964 dollars, was $600. The original designer of the ship is
Walter "Matt" Jeffries, who based the ship's registry number, NCC-1701, on
his 1935 Waco airplane (and whom the term "Jeffries Tubes" was invented
for). After the series, the model was donated to the Smithsonian in 1974,
and was restored due to the appearance of cracking paint, stress cracks,
and failures in the lighting system. A "streaking effect" has been added to
make a "weathered" look, but the paint has changed the model color from
gray to green. The restoration process took six weeks.

...That "Assignment: Earth" was originally a pilot for another series that
Gene Roddenberry proposed but never got off the ground?

...That Majel Barrett's real name is Majel Leigh Hudec. The name change was
in order to hire her as Christine Chapel.

...That "Plato's Stepchildren" was the first episode in television history
to feature an interracial kiss?

...In "Assignment: Earth", Spock, upon reviewing 1968 Earth history, says
that "There will be an important assassination today." A few days after
this episode originally aired, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was shot and
killed.

...How the transporter effect was filmed:

   * Sprinkle glitter against a black background and shine a light through
     it. Film it.
   * Film the scene, first with the actor, then without (or vice versa)
   * Matte the glitter over the actor, and double-expose the film

...the title of "Bread and Circuses" comes from Juvenal, a Roman satirist
of the first century AD, who wrote, "The people that once bestowed
commands, consulships, legions, and all else, now concerns itself no more,
and longs eagerly for just two things bread and circuses!" [ref The Best of
Trek #13, p. 134]

Shakespeare
-=========-
William Shatner was trained as Shakespearean actors. The problem with
Shatner's acting is that he apparently has never made the transition in
style from stage acting to television acting. His overacting and wild
motions work fine on stage, just not as well on a TV set where the camera
picks up every move much better. Patrick Stewart had the same problem
during the first season of Star Trek: The Next Generation. William Shatner
holds Sir Lawrence Olivier as his favorite performer because of the late
actor's technical skill and ability to project emotion. Olivier continues
to be revered as the greatest modern Shakespearean actor.

Anyway, there have been many references to Shakespeare on the original
series, either though episode titles or through quotations by the
characters. The key is that the title and reference are in quotations. The
2.1.39 means Act 2, Scene 1, Line 39.

9. Dagger of the Mind - This line is referenced in "Macbeth 2.1.39", and
can be best summarized in "Macbeth 2.1.34-50".

13. The Conscience of the King - This line is referenced in "Hamlet
2.2.606", and can be best summarized in "Hamlet 2.2.589-606". This episode
is based largely on Hamlet. The basic plot is similar, and there are many
plot devices that are duplicated in the episode from the play, such as the
troupe of actors. Additionally, many of Shakespeare's characters find
analogs in Star Trek. Here is a list of crossovers: Hamlet -> Kirk,
Claudius -> Karidian (Kodos), Ophelia -> Lenore, and Ghost of Hamlet's
Father -> Tom Leighton This episode also contains several themes lifted
from Macbeth, as one would expect since the episode opens with a scene from
an "Arcturian Macbeth." The analogs seem to be: Macbeth -> Karidian, Lady
Macbeth -> Lenore, and Macduff -> Kirk Toward the end of the episode, the
Karidian Company of Actors performs Hamlet. Karidian, playing Hamlet's
father, speaks the lines from "Hamlet 1.5.10-24", but, unforunately, omits
several lines. Later, Lenore quotes the Soothsayer in "Julius Caesar
1.2.18&23": "Caesar, beware the Ides of March", and then paraphrases
Fortinbras from "Hamlet 5.2.36-63"

51. By Any Other Name - Kirk says as he holds out a rose-like flower and
says, "As the Earth poet Shakespeare wrote, `That which we call a rose by
any other name would smell as sweet.'" This line comes from "Romeo and
Juliet 2.2.43-44"

68. Elaan of Troyius - The plot for this episode was taken from The Taming
of the Shrew. As with "The Conscience of the King," some of Shakespeare's
characters find analogs within the episode: Petruchio -> Kirk, and
Katherine -> Elaan

69. Whom Gods Destroy - Martha quotes Shakespeare's eighteenth sonnet,
which Garth replies, "You wrote that?". This was probably an allusion to
the Elizabethan practice of rewriting preexisting poems and stories, using
huge amounts of the same text. (It was considered bad writing not to.)

78. All Our Yesterdays - This title comes from "Macbeth 5.5.22", with
surrounding text from "Macbeth 5.5.17-28".

Other
-===-
1. The Man Trap - Sulu says a line written by Gene Roddenberry, "May the
Great Bird of the Galaxy roost on our planet". After this reference was
filmed, Gene Roddenberry got the nickname of the Great Bird.

44. The Trouble With Tribbles - The writer, David Gerrold, came up with the
idea independent of Heinlein. When Desilu or NBC discovered the crossover,
Gene and David called up Heinlein, who simply laughed it off, then said to
go ahead and use it.

53. The Ultimate Computer - The term "human engrams" may possibly come from
a L. Ron Hubbard novel.

Operation SNAFU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[It is currently impossible for me to verify these SNAFUs, since my local
station in the area hasn't shown TOS for over 4 years]

The number by each episode is airing order of each episode.

Where's Scotty's Finger?
-======================-
James Doohan is missing the middle finger of his right hand. During World
War II, he served in the Royal Canadian Artillery (not the air force,
although he flew - like a maniac - often) for six years and two months and
lead the fifth Landing Craft Assault. He was on the ground when his middle
finger caught three bullets; the head wound and other wounds did no damage.
He then became a flight instructor before leaving the military in October
of 1945.

If you look at his hand, you'll see a faint red streak, indicating the
entire metacarpal bone was surgically removed. Usually, if Scotty's hands
were called for in a script to operate the transporter, we cut to a shot of
someone else's hands. Usually, we'll see Scotty's hands behind some object
or side on. However, here are some scenes where the missing finger is
visible:

5. The Enemy Within - When Scotty reaches into the cage in order to get the
bad god-like, you can see his missing finger.

34. The Apple - Scotty's clenched fist. (UV)

44. The Trouble With Tribbles - After Kirk notices what he got for his
chicken sandwich and coffee, Scotty walks in carrying a whole bundle of
tribbles. The missing finger is clearly noticeable. (V)

Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home - When McCoy hands Scotty the mouse in Dr.
Nichols' office, Scotty lack of digitude is noticeable for a second. (UV)

Star Trek V: The Final Frontier - When Uhura tosses Scotty the bag of food,
the missing finger is noticeable.

Star Trek: The Next Generation: Relics - Scotty's missing finger can be
noticed a few times, notably in Ten-Forward and on the original Enterprise
in the Holodeck.

2. Charlie X -

   * Kirk enters a turbolift with the boy Charlie, en route to the bridge,
     wearing his usual uniform shirt with the badge on the left breast.
     When they emerge from the lift, Kirk is wearing his yellow-green
     wrap-around shirt with the badge down near the waist. Yet for the rest
     of the show (after the bridge scene and some shirtless scenes in the
     Enterprise gymnasium) he retains his usual shirt. (UV)
   * When Kirk talks with the chef, he is seen in a close-up, but the image
     is reversed (look at the hair part). (UV)
   * Charlie is on McCoy's examination table, actively peddling. We switch
     to a camera view of the indicator panel, where a reflection of Charlie
     is shown, with Charlie motionless. The camera then cuts back to
     Charlie, who is fully active. Then, back to the panel, where shows
     Charlie's reflection motionless, and then back to Charlie. (UV)

4. The Naked Time - After Nurse Chapel infects Spock with "the disease",
Spock goes into the conference room to get control of his emotions. The
door plate on this room is on the LEFT side of the door. After Kirk enters,
a bit of dramatics, Spock leaves, then Kirk leaves, we see that the
doorplate has moved to the RIGHT side of the door. (UV)

5. The Enemy Within -

   * When he's on the planet, Kirk's gold shirt has the usual emblem on.
     When he beams back aboard, the emblem is missing. He swoons, and
     Scotty helps him out of the transporter room. After the break, we see
     Scotty and Kirk in the corridor, and the emblem is back. (The order of
     these may be reversed, but the emblem definitely "winks" in and out.)
     (UV)
   * Strange clothing changes. (UV)
   * Bad-Kirk's scratch on his face switches sides. (UV)
   * When Bad-Kirk demands brandy from McCoy, the close-up show shows him
     with the Good-Kirk uniform (UV)
   * When Good-Kirk is holding bad Kirk on the transporter pad, his hands
     are touching. Then he talks to Spock and his hands are apart. After
     that, a long shot shows his hands touching again. (UV)
   * When Bad-Kirk demands brandy from McCoy, the close-up show shows him
     with the Good-Kirk uniform. (UV)

6. Mudd's Women - When the women are first beamed up to the Enterprise, it
flashes back and forth between the women and Scott, Spock, and McCoy. If
you watch it carefully, you will see that they spliced in a scene of McCoy
standing in sick bay smiling, and he is wearing a different uniform and has
the medical scanner behind him.

7. What Are Little Girls Made Of - Strange clothing changes. (UV)

11. The Menagerie -

   * The ONLY door handle seen in a Federation setting (ship or starbase,
     etc.) was on the door to Christopher Pike's quarters, which was kind
     of ironic, since he's about the only person who COULDN'T use a door
     handle! (V)
   * Also, during the trial, every senior officer, including McCoy, is
     wearing dress uniforms, except for Scott, who is wearing his regular
     uniform. (UV)

14. Balance of Terror - During the final fight against the Romulan ship,
Sulu launch phasers, but in the second series of photons, we see the impact
but hear no sound. (UV)

15. Shore Leave -

   * As you watch the Kirk/Finnegan fight, ask yourself when Kirk's tunic
     gets ripped. You'll notice that just before we fade to a commercial,
     the camera is on Kirk, who is down and out, and his tunic is perfectly
     whole. Camera cuts to Finnegan, who is standing over Kirk, gloating.
     The camera cuts back to Kirk, whose tunic is ripped to shreds, and we
     fade to a commercial. (UV) Maybe Kirk is Jewish, and rents his garment
     in anguish....
   * Also, when Spock is beaming down, Sulu says, "Look, someone is beaming
     down from the bridge." How could they determine that someone was
     beaming down from the bridge, never mind that it wasn't possible in
     TOS times. (UV)
   * The yeoman gets her uniform torn by Don Juan, and then changes into
     the `princess' costume. When she changes back into her uniform again,
     it has miraculously been repaired. (UV)
   * Spock and Kirk are discussing the tiger that was seen and it appears.
     BUT it clearly has a chain around its neck and when it gets up, the
     chain is clearly seen to extend toward the ground. (UV)
   * In the scene where the caretaker appears for the first time, you can
     see the shadow of a boom pass across the tree in the middle of the
     screen. (UV)

16. The Galileo Seven - After Boma leaves to prepare for one of the
burials, the camera stays on the shuttlecraft door as it closes. A
propman's hand is very visible on the lower part of the door, guiding it
into place. (UV)

17. The Squire Of Gothos - Trelane sees Earth's history about 900 years
late, and talks about Alexander's Hamilton's death (July 12, 1804), and how
he had admired Napoleon (who reigned from November 9, 1799-April 11, 1814;
March 20-June 18, 1815). This places the episode at around the 2700's,
about a few hundred years after when Star Trek: The Next Generation is
stated to occur. (UV)

18. Arena -

   * When Kirk and Spock are taking cover, at the beginning, behind a
     destroyed section of wall, every time Kirk leans against the wall, it
     moves as if it's a Styrofoam prop. (UV)
   * When they are attacked on planet Cesius 3 (?), we see Spock running
     toward James Kirk. Kirk drops a box on the floor. On the next image,
     Spock reaches Jim, but Kirk still hold the box in his hand. (UV)
   * As Kirk through a rock to the Gorn, the rock seems very heavy, but the
     rock flies in the air as it was very light !! Maybe Kirk ate dilitium
     vitamins for Breakfast !! (UV)
   * After that, the rock hits the floor. We see a couple of different
     images, and when the camera is back on the previous image, the rock
     has disappeared. (UV)
   * Right after that, we are back on the bridge. We see Scott. His hair
     seems wet. The camera switches to Spock, and back to scoot, and it's
     hair then seems perfectly dry. (UV)

19. Tomorrow is Yesterday -

   * First off, Kirk says that the "United Earth Space Probe Agency" was
     the authority behind the Enterprise.
   * When Kirk and Sulu hand their belts to the security guard, the antenna
     grids were hanging open, yet the communicators didn't hail the
     Enterprise. A few seconds later, when the guard asked about the
     communicators, the antenna grids were closed.
   * The Lieutenant Colonel who questioned Kirk was violating regulations
     by wearing his Wheel Hat indoors. The Berets on the guards, on the
     other hand, may have been ok. It seems to me that they are allowed
     indoors.
   * When they were just getting ready to beam Christopher back to his jet,
     he trotted down to the transporter console and hit the communicator
     switch. He sure learns fast, huh?
   * The worst problem in this episode, of course, is toward the end. The
     entire scenario of returning Christopher to his aircraft by beaming
     him into his own body is not acceptable. It certainly is possible that
     Christopher was beamed back into the aircraft at the same instant that
     the earlier version of the Enterprise beamed him out. This could
     explain the visual effect. However next he indicated that the UFO had
     disappeared and that he was returning to base. The tractor SHOULD have
     remained on from the earlier Enterprise, and the Christopher who was
     returned to the plane should have gone down with the destroyed
     aircraft presumably bailing out and descending on parachute in such a
     way that the Enterprise sensors did not notice. Also, Christopher
     should have landed on the ground with the full memory of what had
     happened to him on the Enterprise, but hopefully he was ethical enough
     to not do anything with his knowledge that would change the future.
   * In the closing credits, Captain Christopher is listed as a Major. On
     the other hand, this episode, first broadcast in the U.S. on January
     26, 1967, correctly indicated that Apollo 11 would be launched on a
     Wednesday (July 16, 1969, 9:32 A.M., EDT.) Also, the Starfleet uniform
     given to Captain Christopher had Lieutenant's braid on the sleeve.
     Oddly enough, this was correct. An Air Force Captain is equivalent to
     a Navy Lieutenant, and Starfleet follows Navy rank.

20. Court Martial -

   * Kirk says "Gentlemen, this computer has an auditory sensor. It can, in
     effect, hear sounds. By installing a booster we can increase that
     capability on the order of one to the fourth power." Hmmmm, either the
     writers or William Shatner seemed to think that it sound more
     impressive than just plain old "one". And, I guess we have to assume
     that both the voices and the other ship noises were masked out just
     like those heartbeats. (UV)
   * At the end when Kirk is fighting Finney, Kirk's shirt is ripped at his
     right shoulder but his stunt double's shirt is obviously undamaged in
     that area. (UV)

21. Return of the Archons -

   * When the landing party is hemmed in by Landru's legions at both ends
     of an alley, Kirk orders them to fire (on stun). McCoy's phaser
     appears not to fire at all. I suppose animation forgot to do the
     effect. (UV)
   * When Kirk's landing party starts running from the festival, a quick
     shot shows a rock BOUNCING off the head of one of the landing party
     members and up into the air. Now THAT'S a thick head! (UV)
   * When the landing party arrive at the hotel, it is daylight. Kirk talks
     a few minutes and then the landing party is escorted to their room.
     The owner opens a window and it is now pitch black outside. This
     planet might have a short day/night cycle, but their clock system
     seemed to be pretty close to that of the Earth's. (UV)

22. Space Seed -

   * As Kirk is bashing in Khan's glass coffin, his phaser falls off his
     belt. McCoy keeps looking down at it, like he's wondering when they're
     going to yell `cut' so they can re-shoot the scene. They never did
     re-shoot because they didn't want to invest in more glass. (V)
   * During the hearing at the end, when Kirk rings the ship's bell, watch
     McCoy closely. He has a strained, silly grin on his face, as if
     DeForest Kelley is desperately trying to keep from bursting out
     laughing. As Kirk finishes the last ring, McCoy sighs, as if in
     relief, and assumes a more appropriate expression. (UV)

28. The City On The Edge Of Forever -

   * Clark Gable's first film was made in 1930, at which time he was hardly
     a major star, and it would hardly have seemed strange that Kirk and
     McCoy might not have heard of him. "Good Night, Sweetheart" wasn't
     written until 1931.
   * Kirk mentions Orion's belt and points to it in the sky. Orion should
     not be visible in the night sky at that time of year (according to a
     calendar shown on a wall).
   * In the panning shot of the city where a bunch of brick buildings are
     shown, there is a radiation trident on a sign on a wall, which
     normally signifies a fallout shelter. Fallout shelters shouldn't exist
     for years.

30. Amok Time -

   * At the marriage ceremony, as Spock is going up to hit the gong, we get
     two shots of this happening. In the first shot, from the view of
     T'Pau, Spock starts moving toward the gong and then on the right we
     see T'Pring start moving to issue the Kah-if-farr. Then, there is a
     cut looking at the face of T'Pring, who in this scene is standing
     still. After a second, T'Pring starts to move forward to issue the
     challenge.
   * The most graphic one is a long shot of the set during Kirk's talk with
     T'Pau, where we see Nimoy leaning against a wall when,
     continuity-wise, Spock is supposedly kneeling, deep in "plak tow."
     It's also easy to see stage lights in a couple of scenes. (UV)
   * Plus, when Spock goes to bang that gong, it rings before it's hit.
     (UV)
   * Also, T'Pau speaks to everyone else in Elizabethan/Shakespearean/King
     James English to a point of using "thee" and "thy". However, she never
     uses "thou", but, incorrectly uses thee. Spock even uses this
     incorrectly in one instance.

33. Mirror, Mirror - In the beginning of the episode, Kirk calls up the
Enterprise, requests beam up, and puts the communicator back on his belt.
During the partial materialization on the transporter room, the
communicator is in Kirk's hand with the antenna grid fully open. Then, when
the landing party materializes fully in the mirror universe, the
communicator is back on Kirk's belt. (UV)

34. The Apple - Near the end of the show, when the Enterprise fails to
break free of the tractor beam, Scotty falls against the captain's chair
and one of the floorboards comes up off the floor. (UV)

35. The Doomsday Machine -

   * There is at least one side shot of the device where the stars can be
     seen through the far side of the maw. (UV)
   * Scotty loses his brogue for one line. (UV)
   * While the Constellation is being flown into the doomsday machine, the
     model looks as if it was bumped. (UV)

42. Obsession - When Captain Kirk fights an ensign for the right to remain
on the planet, Kirk tosses the ensign against a very solid rock. However,
when that ensign is tossed against that same rock for a second time, that
rock is not so solid and rolls slightly in the manner of a piece of plastic
painted to look like a rock. (UV)

46. A Piece of the Action - When Kirk, Spock, and McCoy first beam down to
the planet, a long shot shows the three of them approaching a bench. Kirk
puts him hand on the bench and McCoy is behind him. A closer shot follows
that shows McCoy standing behind the bench and then Kirk walks into the
shot, behind McCoy, and then arrives at the bench. (UV)

48. A Private Little War - In the closing credits, the Mugato is listed in
the closing credits as Gumato. (Let's just call the whole things off...)

50. Patterns of Force - After Kirk and Spock enter the Zeon hideaway, Spock
repairs a communicator which was disassembled by the Ekosians. As he tries
to test it, he gives the wrist flip, but the antenna grid doesn't open.
Spock glances down and opens it by hand. (UV)

51. By Any Other Name - In one scene Spock was talking with out moving his
lips. It occurs when Spock and the Kelvin Rojan are playing chess and they
are discussing Rojan's response to Kirk kissing the Kelvin woman Kelinda.
Initially we see the two characters playing chess and talking, but the view
then switches to close ups of each person's face as they talk. When Spock
says the line "Captain Kirk seems find her quite attractive" he looks as if
he is thinking about something, but does not say anything. Must be
telepathy. :-) (UV)

52. The Omega Glory - Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are seated and bound,
speculating that the Yangs are Yankees and Cohms are Communists. When the
camera is on the three of them, Kirk's hair is parted one way, yet, when
there is a close-up shot of Kirk, his hair is parted another way. (UV)

53. The Ultimate Computer - Spock and Scotty are in the Jefferies tube and
Kirk and the scientist are below looking at what they are doing. Kirk is
restraining the scientist. From the top view, Kirk is holding him by his
arm. The shot from the floor shows Kirk's arm around his head. (UV)

55. Assignment: Earth - Kirk (in the briefing room) has Scotty on the
tabletop viewscreen. Scotty (in Engineering) gives Kirk a report. Kirk ends
the transmission with Kirk out and reaches to turn off the viewscreen but
the viewscreen turns off before Kirk switches it off. AI at its finest, eh?
(UV)

58. The Paradise Syndrome -

   * The first time Kirk enters the temple he falls in through a (supposed)
     unseen trapdoor. However at the end when he manages to reopen the
     temple the entrance is clearly shown as a large raised sliding door,
     implying Kirk could not possibly have fallen in the first time. (UV)
   * When Spock orders a full power phaser strike on the asteroid Scotty
     can be heard to say "Oh me bearings". (UV)

59. And the Children Shall Lead - At the end of the episode Kirk gives the
order `Set course for Starbase 4', yet he mentions a little earlier that
the security detail was still on the planet Triacus. (UV)

60. Is There In Truth No Beauty? - At the beginning of the episode, it is
established that humans, even with the red visor, would go mad if they saw
the ambassador being transported aboard. However, at the end of the
episode, Kirk watches the ambassador being beamed out without the visor.
Kirk should have gone mad at this point. [This could explain a lot about
what happened during the third season...]

62. Day Of The Dove - There is a prop that is grey, and looks like a grey
hydrant coming out of the wall approximately 18 inches from the floor.
During the big sword fight, we see them fighting by this "hydrant", cut to
another scene, then cut back to see this "hydrant" knocked over.

64. The Tholian Web - When Chekov goes mad and screams, his mouth doesn't
move. (UV)

73. The Lights Of Zetar - Kirk has Romaine put into the pressure chamber in
sick bay, and has the pressure increased by one atmosphere per second. At
that rate, she would have been crushed like a bug in a minute. (UV)

75. The Way to Eden -

   * Although not an actual snafu, Adam's hand twitches after he was
     "dead". However, many muscular spasms do occur after death. (UV)
   * Also, there is a short bit where the film is backwards, and Kirk's
     insignia appears on the wrong side of the shirt. (UV)

76. The Cloud Minders - When Kirk and Spock are first captured by the
miners, Kirk says something like, "What's the meaning of this?", but his
mouth doesn't move. (UV)

78. All Our Yesterdays -

   * Spock claims that his planet is "millions of light years from here".
     This is unusual, since the galaxy is only 100,000 light years across.
     (UV)
   * There's also the comment from the policeman who says he heard Kirk
     speaking with spirits, and heard him call one of them "Bones". The
     only time that Kirk used the name "Bones", the policemen were away
     getting reinforcements. (UV)

79. Turnabout Intruder - In this episode, "the death penalty has been
forbidden. There's only one exception: General Order 4." However, in "The
Menagerie", "General Order 7" is the directive not to travel to Talos IV,
and states, "The only death penalty left on the books."

- Hmmmm.... In "Balance of Terror", Spock says that something called "cast
rodinium" is the hardest substance known to Federation science, and yet,
was pulverized by the Romulan weapon. Yet, in "The Doomsday Machine", Spock
says that there is no known way of blasting through solid neutronium. In
"Arena", diamonds are "the hardest known substance", but in "Obsession", a
rock substance is "twenty times as hard as diamonds. (V)

Theme from Star Trek
Lyrics by Gene Roddenberry
From The Making of Star Trek by Stephen E. Whitfield & Gene Roddenberry

Beyond
The rim of star-light
My love
Is wand'ring in star flight
I know
He'll find in star-clustered reaches
Love,
Strange love a star woman teaches
I know
His journey end never
His star trek
Will go on forever.
But tell him
While he wanders his starry sea
Remember, remember me.

Syndication Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
United States
-===========-
While Star Trek: The Next Generation began it's run as a first-run
syndication series, the animated series was initially seen on cable's
Nickelodeon. Then, the Sci-Fi Channel purchased the rights to the animated
series, and aired the episodes for a time. However, I have no idea where
the series is currently being aired. It is rarely seen in local
syndication.

The entire animated series is available on Paramount Home Video.

Germany
-=====-
While the original length of the episodes was about 25 minutes, they were
cut down to 15-18 minutes in Germany to fit into the children's program
slots. They were aired by the ZDF in 1976, but some of them were left out
without any given reasons.

Here are the episodes, that were aired, with the re-translated titles:

1. Yesteryear -> The Timeportal
2. One Of Our Planets Is Missing -> The Dangerous Cloud
4. More Tribbles, More Troubles -> More Troubles with Tribbles
6. The Infinite Vulcan -> The Superbrain

21. How Sharper than a Serpent's Tooth - The episode title comes from "King
Lear 1.4.285", with surrounding text from "King Lear 1.4.272-286"

Did You Know...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
...the episode "The Slaver Weapon" is an adaptation of Larry Niven's "Known
Space" story The Soft Weapon. Spock replaced a Pierson's Puppeteer.

Canonical Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
None of the information presented in the Animated series is considered
canonical by Paramount in the Star Trek movies or TNG. In other words,

Did you know...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
...That many of the sets constructed for this movie have been re-used and
re-dressed for the subsequent films and have been used (albeit painted
over) on subsequent movies and Star Trek: The Next Generation. One of these
sets was originally used in the TMP Klingon bridge. It was later used as
the TWOK dilithium reactor room, TVH Klingon "lab" where Spock searched for
the identity of the Probe's signal, and on TNG as backgrounds for various
alien ships.

...The initial set construction was originally supposed to be for a new
series that was going to be a flagship of a proposed Paramount 4th network
titled Star Trek: Phase II?

...The recreation deck briefing consisted of mostly Star Trek fans. Word
leaked out that they needed a lot of extras for a day of shooting, and many
fans showed up, on word of mouth alone, for this day of shooting. A casting
call was never issued.

...The original version of the "Spock Walk" sequence had both Spock and
Captain Kirk traveling through V'ger. Because it complicated the flow of
the film, the scene was reshot with Spock alone, and that's what's seen in
the final cut. However, a fraction of this alternate scene remains in the
longer version, where Kirk says, "I have him in sight".

...When Spock travels through V'ger and sees all the incredible imagery,
Darth Vader and Miss Piggy can be seen. It comes right after his line "Who
or what are we dealing with?". Occurs 94 minutes into the film.

Operation SNAFU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   * When the travel pod with Kirk and Scotty dock at the Enterprise they
     are at Cargo 5 (Look over the Door). But the Announcement says Cargo
     6.
   * In one of the extra scenes in the normal Pan and Scan video release,
     where Kirk leaves the airlock and goes after Spock, you can clearly
     see where the set ends and where a variety of girders and other
     construction materials start.
   * An external view of Kirk's travel pod in the space dock shows it
     passing between a spotlight that is illuminating the secondary hull.
     The spot illuminates the travel pod as it passes through it, but the
     travel pod doesn't cast a shadow on the Enterprise.
   * When Chekov gets his hand burned, Ilia goes up to help him. The camera
     cuts to Kirk with his back to the viewer, and Ilia is still sitting in
     her chair. Then, in the next shot, Ilia is seen leaving Chekov and
     going back to sit down.
   * Kirk leaves the Enterprise in one space suit, but retrieves the
     unconscious Spock in another one.
   * During the climactic scene outside of the Enterprise (inside of
     V'ger), Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are all wearing jackets with a colored
     band on the sleeve. Just after they re-enter the Enterprise and are
     back on the bridge, the colors on Spock's and McCoy's jackets are
     switched.
   * As the Enterprise prepares for launch, the drydock is cleared of all
     shuttles and personnel. Yet, we see a shuttle cross Enterprise's path
     seconds before the launch.

Did you know...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
...that all of the actors who played Khan's men were, at the time, male
Chippendale strippers?

...Ricardo Montalban, fresh off working off the series Fantasy Island,
arrived on the set, only to find a surprise waiting. The crew had rigged up
a 3-foot robot with Herve Villechaize face pasted on it. Needless to say,
Ricardo felt at home.

...most of scenes involving Ricardo Montalban were shot before most of the
Star Trek cast showed up for their first day of shooting?

...the bridge of the ship which Khan captures, the Reliant, was actually
the redressed Enterprise bridge set?

...the model of the orbiting space lab is really the space office from Star
Trek: The Motion Picture, just upside down?

...the original concept for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan started out as
a one-page story idea by Harve Bennett. Soon after, Harve Bennett and Jack
Sowards developed the concept into a full-length screenplay titled The
Omega Syndrone. In this script, Khan was not satisfied with just seeking
vengence on Kirk, but wanted to use the Omega System (later to be called
the Genesis project) to conquer the Federation, the Klingons, and the
Romulans. Later, the script was handed to Samuel Peeples, who wrote the
Star Trek episode "Where No Man Has Gone Before". Peeples version dropped
many elements, including Khan. Finally, Harve Bennett turned to Nicholas
Meyer, who combined the elements which worked in the previous versions of
the story. Nicholas Meyer, amazingly, turned around and completed the
script in 12 days.

...the original title was to be The Vengence of Khan, but this was changed
because the second sequel to Star Wars (1977) (then titled Revenge of the
Jedi) was to be released near the same time. In the end both movie tiles
were changed.

...that there are several books in the container that shelters Khan's
followers on Ceti Alpha VI. Two of the titles are Moby Dick and King Lear,
and a lot of Khan's lines are directly taken from those books. In
particular, the final monologue of Khan is identical to the last words of
Captain Ahab from Melville's book.

...that the "Genesis" sequence called for a long and massive explosion. ILM
rented the Cow Palace in San Francisco for the effect. They covered the
ceiling with a black cloth and placed the camera on the floor looking up at
it. The explosion would occur directly above the camera so the fall-out
would appear to rush directly towards the point of view. A special
high-speed camera was constructed. One of it's components was a spinning
prism, which bent the image onto the film as it rushed past. This increased
exposure time without having to slow the frame rate. The camera ran at
2,500 frames per second, which meant that the 0:01.20 long explosion would
appear to take 1:40.

...that director Nicholas Meyer envisioned the film as the ultimate
extension of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry's idea of ``Horatio
Hornblower in space''. Therefore, prior to filming he had the cast watch
Captain Horatio Hornblower for inspiration.

...When Spock and Savik speak to each other in Vulcan, the actors actually
spoke in English, and then sound people created the Vulcan words to match
the movements of the actors' mouths.

...One scene that was dropped in the final cut, but resurfaced in network
television, has Admiral Kirk doing an inspection of the Engineering crew.
Midshipman Peter Preston is interviewed by Kirk. The scene that was dropped
went like this....

     Kirk: You're a tiger.
     Scotty: My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.

...Another scene dropped from final edit involved a romance between Savak
and David. The clip is presumed lost.

Operation SNAFU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   * Keep an eye out on the sensor section when the enterprise leaves
     spacedock.
   * Saavik refers to the Gamma Hydra system, and a few minutes later
     Klingon warships attack. In "The Deadly Years" from Star Trek, we are
     told that the Gamma Hydra system borders on Romulan space. Either (1)
     the Klingons won it in a war or trade, (2) the system is where
     Klingon, Romulan, and Federation space intersect, (3) The Romulans
     allow Klingons to patrol their space, (4) the continuity people
     screwed up.
   * One of the best known SNAFU's is when Khan says to Chekov, "I never
     forget a face". "Space Seed" aired during the first season of Star
     Trek, and Chekov joined the crew during the second season. It was
     known before production started that this was an error, and yet, the
     powers that be did not want to leave out Walter Koenig.
   * In the first scene on the bridge of the USS Reliant, the ship's
     technical diagram on the back wall is for an Enterprise-type ship, not
     the Reliant.
   * When Kirk, McCoy, and Savik beam aboard Regula 1, Kirk orders phasers
     on stun. It appears that Kirk and Savik each have their respective
     phasers set correctly, as indicated by a single glowing light. McCoy,
     though, seems to have his set to kill, with all the lights blinking in
     sequence, through the cycle. I imagine this is the kill setting, as
     Capt. Terrell's phaser behaves similarly before he kills an
     unfortunate Genesis project scientist and finally himself.
   * The blood stain on Kirk's jacket is constantly changing from Scotty
     dying realitve.
   * Saavik mentions that visual and tactical displays don't function in
     the Mutara Nebula. Sulu has a lot of difficulty locating and hitting
     the Reliant, but Spock's scanners are able to pinpoint the Reliant's
     impulse engines and get a clear reading of the Genesis Wave. Later,
     Chekov not only scores three direct hits on the Reliant, but he also
     knows the exact distance from Reliant before the Genesis device
     exploded (4000 km).
   * Audio isn't properly synched up when the debris falls on Joachim.
   * When Joachim, one of Khan's injured men, is injured and says, "Yours
     is the superior intellect", he then dies with his eyes open. However,
     when Khan hugs him, his eyes suddenly close.
   * Saavik says that "shields will be useless" in the nebula. However, the
     Enterprise enters Warp from inside the nebula.... it should have been
     crushed since navigational deflectors are a type of shield.
   * Towards the end when the Enterprise and the Reliant have fought the
     Reliant is still in the Mutara Nebula. However, in the shot where we
     see the Reliant explode, it is in free space, and the nebula is
     nowhere to be seen.
   * During Spock's death scene, keep on eye on Kirk

Operation SNAFU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   * In "The Menagerie-Part One", Spock says "This is the Enterprise, 13
     years ago". Yet, during Star Trek III, the Admiral says "There will be
     no refit of Enterprise... she's twenty years old." This would mean
     that most of TOS, the lost years, Star Trek I and II would have taken
     place within seven years. Also, Kirk specifically states that he had
     not seen Khan in fifteen years. Perhaps Starfleet was embarrassed
     about the Genesis project and wanted to deny Kirk his ship.
   * When Chekov detects an intruder in Spock's quarters, the graphics used
     are that of a TOS style Constitution class ship, not that of a Movie
     style refit. Perhaps the Starfleet computer contractors screwed up and
     installed improper graphic files?
   * The apparent size of the Bird of Prey changes several times during the
     movie. At the beginning, it looks huge, but, at the end, it's smaller.
   * The Enterprise barely clears the space dock doors. No other space dock
     doors are shown, and the interior of the dock looks rather confining.
     However, the Excelsior, shown to be easily bigger than the Enterprise,
     somehow got out of the docking area without delay.
   * The arragement of Kirk's duelling pistols on the wall in the
     background when Sarek and Kirk are talking in Kirk's home.
   * When Kirk and Kruge are fighting, a piece of the cliff breaks away and
     wiggles down the side of the cliff rather than falling like a rock.

Shakespeare
~~~~~~~~~~~
McCoy quotes the famous line, "Angels and ministers of grace, defend us!"
from Hamlet 1.4.39. The entire passage is in "Hamlet 1.4.39-57".

Did you know...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
...In the scene where Uhura and Chekov are looking for the nuclear vessels,
a woman passes by and says "Across the bay, in Alameda." The scene was
originally written with no one responding, and the woman was just passing
by, unaware of any shooting that was going on. They had to track her down
to get her release on the film, and she just asked for a day's pay.

...Part of the reason whales were featured in this film was because both
William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy are members of the "Save The Whales"
organization.

...Some shots of the whales were in fact four foot long animatronic models.
Four models were created, and were so realistic that after release of the
film, US fishing authorities publically criticised the film makers for
getting too close to whales in the wild. The scenes involving these whales
were shot in a highschool swimming pool. The shot of the whales swimming
past the Golden Gate Bridge were filmed on location, and nearly ended in
disaster when a cable got snagged on a nuclear submarine and the whales
were towed out to sea.

...Kirk Thatcher is an independent record producer, television producer,
and special effects/animatronics technician. That was his own hair and punk
rock band playing on the bus during Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.

Operation SNAFU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   * The Klingon bridge received a complete makeover between III and IV.
   * The Klingon transporter is shown to have 4 pads. However, in III, six
     Klingons were beamed down at once. (Maybe they hugged....) Also,
     according to the "Day of the Dove", Klingon transporters are silent.
   * In the dinner scene between Kirk and Gillian, the candle in the middle
     of the table is constantly changing position.
   * When Scotty is holding the mouse, his middle finger is missing.
   * A boom mike visible after the President gives his warning, Kirk gets
     up to talk to Spock.
   * Watch the hand that Kirk uses the phaser with when rescuing Chekov.
   * After leaving the Cetacean Institute, Kirk and Spock are offered a
     ride back into San Francisco by Gillian; but from the view of the
     Golden Gate Bridge in the background, it's clear that they're already
     back in San Francisco.
   * Sound stage wall visible through the hatch that Spock blows after the
     Klingon ship crashes into San Francisco Bay.

Did You Know...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
...That the shuttlebay in Star Trek V is the repainted royal throne room
from Eddie Murphy's "Coming To America."

...Industrial Light and Magic was unable to do the special effects work for
Star Trek V because they were overloaded with the effects work for
RCA/Columbia's Ghostbusters II and Paramount's Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade. A stock shot from Star Trek IV was used in Star Trek V, and thus,
ILM has to receive credit.

...The name "Shaka-Ri" is a play on words from the original actor asked to
play the part of Sybok: Sean Connery.

...The Star Trek book "Probe" was originally to be used as the story for
this movie.

...The movie was originally to be an extension of an episode of the
original television series. In the movie, they would be searching for the
villain. During filming, they changed to the "Search for God".

...The surface of Shaka-Ri as viewed during reconnaissance by Captain Kirk
was generated from an electron microscope image of a lobster's claw.

...One of William Shatner's daughters appears as the yeoman that holds
Kirk's malfunctioning Captain's log.

...The cat creature that Kirk fights on Nimbus III screams exactly the same
as James Brown.

Operation SNAFU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While many Star Trek fans consider the entire film to be a SNAFU, here are
some specific mistakes....

   * Captain Kirk's clothing changes color when Kirk is climbing the
     mountain.
   * In the opening sequence, when Kirk falls off the cliff, Spock catches
     him before he crashes into the ground. Right after he's caught, take a
     close look at his shirt. One part of it is puffed out where wires are
     attached to keep Shatner from swaying back and forth.
   * The citizens of Nimbus III, "The Planet of Galactic Peace", were
     forbidden any weapons, yet General Koord carries a pistol, and the
     people in the bar have a gatling gun.
   * Starfleet Headquarters is in the same time zone as Yosemite. When
     Kirk, Spock and McCoy leave Yosemite, it's dark; yet, when they are
     aboard the Enterprise talking to "Bob" from Starfleet, it's daytime in
     the background. Maybe "Bob" uses a fake window, a la "Total
     Recall"....
   * If you watch the far side of the Galileo when it first lands in the
     hanger deck, you can see the feet of some stage hands rolling the
     shuttle into place just in front of the advancing fog.
   * When Kirk, Spock, and McCoy shoot up the access way aboard the
     Enterprise while escaping Sybok's men, watch the deck numbering. They
     pass by deck 52 twice (presumable because there are 52 cards in a
     playing deck). Also, the decks in turboshaft 3 are numbered one to
     seventy-eight. The Enterprise is only 71 meters in overall draft,
     which would give each deck just under one meter of height.
   * Where did Uhura find palm leaves in a desert?
   * When the Klingons fire on the Enterprise, it just had used the
     transporters so the shields must be down. Yet, there is not one mark
     on the ship to indicate a torpedo hit.
   * Luckinbill's hair gets shorter during the movie.
   * A wire is seen holding the cat dancer's tail.

Did you know....
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
...William Shatner was distressed when he saw how wide his bottom was in
the scene where he walks across the bridge (away from the camera). He had
them airbrush the entire scene to make his butt look narrower.

...General Chang's eyepatch has three bolts that go into the skull. They
all have the Klingon insignia engraved on them.on

...Frankie and Johnny was being filmed in the same studio, and required Al
Pacino to have a surprised expression on his face after opening a door.
Director Garry Marshall arranged for Kirk and Spock be on the other side of
the door that Pacino opened.

...After filming was through one day nearing the end of production, Kim
Cattrall posed nude for some steamy photos on the bridge set.

...The traitor on the Enterprise was originally intended to be Saavik, but
creator Gene Roddenbery convinced the producers that Saavik was too popular
to have her become a villian.

...Shatner originally wanted Sulu to not command a starship, but producers
overrode his wishes.

Changes from theater version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When Star Trek VI was released to home video, it added several scenes,
including the following:

   * A scene in which a potential rescue plan is discussed with a Colonel
     West.
   * A scene in the torpedo tubes in which it is revealed that Klingons
     have no tear ducts.
   * The final scene in which the assassin is revealed to be Colonel West.

TNG Sets
~~~~~~~~
   * Look closely at the warp engines in Engineering. Straight out of TNG.
   * When Scotty is looking at the prints for the Enterprise, look behind
     him. There are the windows for the briefing room. This room was also
     redressed for the dining room, and, in reconstruction for TNG's fifth
     season, they damaged the wall.
   * Also, look at the presidents office. If you look closely where the
     view screen is located, you could swear, by the placement, that a
     certain bar seems to belong there also. Also, look at the windows and
     the entryway. The president's office is Ten-Forward.

Shakespeare
~~~~~~~~~~~
The subtitle "The Undiscovered Country" comes from "Hamlet 3.1.80". In
addition to the title of the movie, the following make further reference to
Hamlet's soliloquy: First, when Chancellor Gorkon toast to "The
Undiscovered Country", and then, with General Chang just before the photon
torpedo hits his ship.

Many have criticized the movie's use of "the undiscovered country" in
applying it to the future rather than death. Yet change is the death of
that which is familiar to us. Like Hamlet, Kirk asks himself, "To be or not
to be." If the Federation allies itself with the Klingon Empire, it will be
the death of the universe as he knows it. It could, in fact, be disastrous:
"ills that we know not of" might await the Federation should peace be made.
The undiscovered country could be too agonizing, so it is safer to cling to
the "ills we have, [rather] than fly to others that we know not of." Of
course, the undiscovered country may also be wonderful beyond description.
That is the dilemma Hamlet faced, and it is also the dilemma which Kirk
faces, though (like Hamlet) Kirk does not face this possibility for some
time, preferring to cling to the familiar ills of war and hatred.

As viewers, we are quite aware of just what lies in the undiscovered
country Kirk was so afraid of. We have seen the next generation of
explorers (even if they never explore anything). I find it amusing that the
"ills we know not of" happen to be seen weekly as Star Trek: The Next
Generation.

Further Shakespeare references:

As the Klingons leave the Enterprise, Chang says:

   * "Parting is such sweet sorrow." Romeo and Juliet 2.2.184
   * "Have we not heard the chimes at midnight?" 2 Henry IV 3.2.212
     [paraphrase]

During the trial scene, Chang says:

   * "Let us sit upon the ground And tell sad stories of the death of
     kings" Richard II 3.2.155-56

And during the final show-down, Chang says:

   * "Once more into the breach, dear friends." Henry V 3.1.1
   * "There's a divinity that shapes our ends Rough-hew them how we will"
     Hamlet 5.2.10-11
   * "This above all: to thine own self be true." Hamlet 1.3.78
   * "If you have tears, prepare to shed them now." Julius Caesar 3.2.168
   * "How long will a man lie in space ere he rot?" Hamlet 5.1.163
     [paraphrase]
   * "Our revels now are ended." The Tempest 3.1.148
   * "Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of
     outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles . . ."
     Hamlet 3.1.58-60
   * "Hath not a Klingon hands, organs . . . affections, passions? Tickle
     us, do we not laugh? Prick us, do we not bleed? Wrong us, shall we not
     revenge?" Merchant of Venice 3.1.56-63 [paraphrase]
   * "I am constant as the northern star." Julius Caesar 3.1.60
   * "The game's afoot." Henry V 3.1.32
   * "Cry `havoc!' and let slip the dogs of war." Julius Caesar 3.1.274
   * "To be or not to be." Hamlet 3.1.57

It should be noted that General Chang, the Shakespeare-quoting Klingon, was
played by Christopher Plummer. Plummer is an accomplished Shakespearean
actor. He played Macbeth in a 1988 Broadway production of the play.

Operation SNAFU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   * When the Excelsior is hit by the subspace shock wave, Valtane is
     standing near Sulu at the captain's chair. The next few scenes show
     crewmembers being shaken about. One of the scenes shows Valtane at his
     station behind a few crewmembers. The next scene has Valtane next to
     Sulu again (walking back to his station, I believe). That's one heck
     of a shock wave.
   * In VI, Valeris flies the Enterprise-A out of dock under 1/4 impulse
     power, and it zooms out in 2 seconds. However, in Star Trek III: The
     Search For Spock, that same sequence takes over 2 minutes for both the
     Enterprise and the Excelsior.
   * McCoy, at one point, had to shoot someone with a hypospray. While the
     hypo was designed to look like the original series hypo, McCoy used it
     backwards.
   * The time at the top of the viewscreen reads "01:18" (I don't recall
     seconds) when the photon torpedoes were fired at Kronos I. A short bit
     later, the screen read 01:38. It seems odd the sequence of the
     assassination took 20 minutes. Sure enough, an even shorter bit later,
     the time read 01:29.
   * Kirk and McCoy are arrested over two hours after Gorkon is
     assassinated (watch the clocks). However, it is implied that they
     beamed over immediately. They must've switched over to Klingon
     Daylight Time...
   * Kirk's trial begins at around 9 AM Federation time, goes past 11, 3,
     and 6 once, and then goes to around 11:30. That's over 14 hours....
     the trial was at a snail's pace.
   * When Kirk is recording the log entry that will be used against him in
     court, he says (re Klingons): "I can never forgive them for the death
     of my boy." Later, at the trial when it is played back it says "I have
     never been able to forgive them..."
   * During the interrogation sequence, a clock behind Scotty reads several
     minutes earlier than the previous shot. It's with his line, "Then
     we're dead."
   * The Federation President is told by Chancellor Azetbur that any
     attempt to rescue the prisoners will be considered an act of war. As
     she is saying this, the plans for Operation: Retrieve are just a few
     feet away from the President!
   * Deck labels indicate that the transporter room is on Deck 7, yet, when
     the officers discover the bodies of the conspirators, they're on Deck
     8.
   * When Kirk and McCoy are on Rura Penthe, and that tall alien is
     definitely on about something, McCoy says, "He's definitely on about
     something, Jim." However, that piece of a dialog is captured on two
     shots, and, in the first half of the shot, McCoy's lips are not
     moving. (UV)
   * During the fight between Kirk and the Cameloid McCoy is knocked down,
     Kirk and creature are wrestling. in a Overhead shot you see them
     rolling towards McCoy feet... yet in the next frame (close up) they
     roll over his chest. (UV)
   * The cloaked bird of prey is defeated by a gas-seeking torpedo - Lt.
     Uhuru having suggested the use of "the equipment we're carrying to
     chart gaseous planetary anomalies". At the beginning of the film, it
     is the Excelsior which is carrying this equipment, not the Enterprise.
     In fact, the Enterprise is in space dock when Kirk et.al. first set
     off. This was explained by the producers as a mistake that wasn't
     caught until the movie was nearly released, and it was too late to fix
     it, so they just left it in, figuring that the nit-pickers could
     rationalize a way around the problem.
   * The Klingons on the bird of prey have purple blood, but the Klingon at
     the end has red blood, which is seen on the spike on his shoulder. It
     was later revealed in the video version that the assassin was Human in
     Klingon disguise. (V)
   * The closing credits have Uhura listed as "Uhuru". Oops, although Uhuru
     is the proper Swahili spelling for "Freedom".

                    Star Trek References in Other Media

Since Star Trek is part of American culture, it's only natural that other
shows have Star Trek references in them. Some of these references
include....

Airplane II: The Sequel (1982)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
William Shatner has a small role in this film. When he looks into the
viewer, he sees a fly-by of the Enterprise.

Crimson Tide (1995)
~~~~~~~~~~~~
When Lt. Cmdr. Hunter talks to Vossler about fixing the radio, he uses the
allegory of Captain Kirk about asking Scotty for more power......

Hunter: "You ever watch Star Trek?... Star Trek, you know, Star Trek, the
USS Enterprise, the whole... All right, you remember when the Klingons were
gonna to blow up the Enterprise and Captain Kirk calls down to Scotty, and
says `Scotty, I got to have more power.'"

Vossler: "He need mo-mo-more warp speed."

Hunter: "Warp speed, exactly, well, I'm Captain Kirk, you're Scotty, I need
more power. I'm telling you, if you do not get this radio up, a billion
people are gonna die. Now, it's all up to you. I know that's a shitty deal,
but you've got it. Can you handle it? (Pause) Scotty?"

Vossler: "Aye, Captain."

Later....

Hunter: "Radio, Con. Mr. Vossler, this is Captain Kirk. I need warp speed
on that radio."

In Living Color
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Wrath Of Ferrekhan - Minister Ferrekahn arrives, and accuses Kirk of
racial indifference.

- (Second Skit)

Loose Cannons (1990)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At one point in the film, Dan goes off into a stream of dialog from Star
Trek rattling off various phrases.

The Running Man (1987)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Apparently, one of the forms of entertainment that is banned in this
futuristic film is Star Trek, as this piece of dialog indicates....

Mic: "Begin satellite coding sequence. Load up link code into transponder
grid. Shunt power to main circuits. Mr. Spock, you have the con."

Underground Tech: "Who is Mr. Spock?"

Saturday Night Live
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- This parody has the crew of the Enterprise facing a fate worse than
Klingons - NBC Executives that want to cancel Star Trek.

William Shatner - In his most infamous scene, Willian Shatner shows up at a
Star Trek convention, and ends up uttering his more infamous line, "Get A
Life!"

William Shatner - Later, in that same show, the Enterprise is a theme
restaurant, being inspected by Khan.

(1992) - The various presidential candidates visit a Star Trek convention

She-Wolf Of London
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Beyond The Beyond - The main characters attend the 25th anniversary of the
show "Beyond The Beyond", a very obvious (and insulting) spoof of "Star
Trek". The episode was shot in 1991, the same year as Trek's 25th
Anniversary.

Tiny Toon Adventures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A Quack In The Quarks - When you see the spaceship hanger, hit the freeze
frame on your VCR. There are several recognizable ships, including the
Enterprise.

Cinemaniacs: Duck Trek - Title says it all. Plucky Duck plays Captain Kirk
who goes visiting a planet in order to get a hair piece.

Hollywood Plucky - In the restaurant scene, Plucky and Hampton are waiters,
and one of the tables is seated Kirk, McCoy, and Spock. There is a slight
problem with the chicken.... so they phaser it!

                    August 19, 1921 - October 24, 1991

He created a legend which continues on today, creating a show that has
helped believe that there was a future worth living for. He showed us that
space is not just for space battles, but for learning new ideas and ways of
thinking, and, indirectly, has done more for civil rights and the space
program than Martin Luther King, Jr. and John F. Kennedy. Gene will be
missed, but will not be forgotten.
