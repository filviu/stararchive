               Star Trek: The Next Generation List of Lists
                          compiled by Mark Holtz
                       Last Revised February 8, 1997

DISCLAIMER: Star Trek, Enterprise, and all other related items are
copyright and trademarks of Paramount Communications. Any infringement of
these lists on Paramount's legitimate copyright and trademarks is purely
unintentional, and will be corrected upon proper notification. These lists
are for the enjoyment of the reader only, and may not be sold. Some items
in these lists are taken from Mike Brown's "ST:TNG Program Guide", and no
copyright infringement is intended. This list is only intended to
supplement Mr. Brown's guide, not replace it. You are highly recommended to
purchase Mr. Brown's guide.

This is the "Star Trek: The Next Generation List of Lists". It contains a
listing of all the episodes for Star Trek: The Next Generation TV series,
plus some added notes. These lists will be updated from time to time. Other
list of lists available include:

   * Star Trek (Original Series) List of Lists
   * Star Trek: Deep Space Nine List of Lists
   * Star Trek: Voyager List of Lists
   * Babylon 5 List of Lists
   * Quantum Leap List Of Lists
   * Reno List of Lists
   * Las Vegas List of Lists

Due to previous problems, no print copies will be made available.

If you are wondering why I compile these lists, it is strictly out of the
enjoyment of Star Trek, and the wealth of information from fellow fans who
post on the electronic networks. (And they're still growing). The only
payment I ask is thanks and contributions. I am not making a dime off these
compilations.

Did you know: In PDP-11 assembly language, there was a set of instructions
that were specifically implemented for making linked lists. A linked list
is a list that points to either another list or a piece of data. In the
instruction manuals I read, these were referred to as "lists of lists"
(unless, of course, the linked list pointed only to data). (Thanks to Paul
Hoffman)

Syndication Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The production code numbers begin with 101 in order to prevent confusion
with the original Star Trek series.

United States/Canada
-==================-
Broadcast Television
-++++++++++++++++++-
When the show was in production, Star Trek: The Next Generation was a
first-run syndication program that was sold to each individual station. It
was not part of the Fox network, although many of the stations that ran
Star Trek: The Next Generation were Fox affiliates. Because of the
first-run status, all the stations had to record the program weekly during
a Saturday feed (the Sat. Date), and had a second opportunity to record the
program during a Sunday re-feed. Each station then ran the program during
the official "Week-Of", which ran from the following Monday until Sunday.

Star Trek: The Next Generation is now in daily "strip" syndication. With
the exception of Encounter At Farpoint, there is no editing by Paramount
television in order to make room for more commercials. Any such editing is
being done by your local station. Encounter At Farpoint is being
distributed as a two-part episode, with several scenes being moved around,
some other scenes being shortened or cut, and some of the audio being
changed. All of the episodes are suppossed to be aired in production code
order, although this can cause some problems. Many stations have aired the
first season episode Skin of Evil before Symbiosis, and another error that
has occurred is that stations air Suddenly Human, Brothers, and Family in
that order instead of Family, Brothers, and "Suddenly Human".

Currently, it is permissible for Star Trek: The Next Generation to be
subject to "Syndication Exclusivity" rules. Thus, if, on your local cable
system, both your local station and an out of town station both carry Star
Trek: The Next Generation, your local station can have the out of town
station's Star Trek: The Next Generation broadcasts blacked out on cable.

Beginning with the fourth season, the episodes were recorded with Dolby
Surround for rear speaker sounds (but is 100% compatible with stereo sets).
If your station broadcasts Star Trek: The Next Generation in stereo, yet,
sometimes, the audio seems to disappear during the broadcast for a couple
of seconds or seems to be coming out of the wrong channels, then you have a
problem which can only be corrected at the broadcast station. Call up your
local station and talk with the chief engineer. Tell him (or her) that Star
Trek: The Next Generation, starting in the fourth season, has Dolby
Surround as part of the stereo audio. This Dolby Surround information is
confusing the "audio anti-phase detector", and that the detector should be
removed to avoid future problems with the Star Trek: The Next Generation's
audio. Then, thank the Chief Engineer for his time.

Laser Disk [Is this information accurate?]
-++++++++-
For laser disk fans, Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes are available
from:

LaserDisc Fan Club

Video Tape
-++++++++-
Many episodes are available through Paramount Home Video.

Also, Columbia House Video Library is distributing TNG on VHS video tape.
Encounter At Farpoint is carried on these series of tapes as a two-hour
movie, as seen originally in 1987. However, the box says two-part, since
the original run of cassettes was the two-part chopped version. All the
other episodes are being distributed in a uncut form. The episode are
ordered according to Production Code number. To order, call Columbia House
for more information at 1-800-538-7766.

Australia
-=======-
Star Trek: The Next Generation is shown on Channel 9 on Tuesday and
Thursday nights, but is interrupted once or twice every several weeks. The
episodes are slighly edited in order to fit in more commercials. As of
September, 1993, they were in the fourth season.

The series originally was first shown in the middle of 1991 at 7:30 pm on
Wednesdays with 1st seasons episodes mixed in with later season episodes,
especially ones with Whoopi Goldberg in them in order to attact viewers.
However, it was then pulled off the air. It reappeared on Thursday nights
at 11:00pm, then shifted to Tuesday nights where it aired at 11:30 PM.

Belgium
-=====-
Star Trek: The Next Generation is shown once a week on Sunday afternoons at
17:00 on VTM. As of May 1993, they are airing season 3.

England/United Kingdom
-====================-
[Before the IRA lobs a bomb at me for referring to England ;), please note
that many people refer to England in the United States, and, besides,
listing all of the parts would take too long. (It would be like listing all
fifty states instead of United States above.) Now, when will the BBC
produce new Dr. Who episodes?]

The series was being broadcast on BBC2 Wednesdays at 6 PM, however, they
have stopped after the airing of the two-part episode "The Best of Both
Worlds".

However, some notes on the following episodes:

   * Conspiracy - The scene with the mother creature is edited out.
   * The Icarus Factor - The pain sticks ceremony is heavily edited.
   * Shades of Gray - The flashbacks include the scene from "Conspiracy"
     with the mother creature....intact!
   * The High Ground - This episode is unaired because the theme of the
     episode, terrorism, could cause problems. In this episode, Data makes
     a reference to a successful use of terrorism in 2017.

Sky Television now holds the rights to broadcast Star Trek: The Next
Generation, and is currently in the middle of the sixth season. It is aired
at 5 PM and 10:30 PM Mondays through Fridays. There is some slight editing
in the 5 PM showing, but no editing at the 10:30 showing. Sky has restored
scenes cut from the above episodes, and has also aired The High Ground as
an previously unscreened episode on ??????, however, some scenes were
missing. Also, Sky has begun scrambling as of September [of which year?].

Finland
-=====-
The series is titled "Star Trek - Uusi Sukupolvi", which, translated, means
"Star Trek - The New Generation". The Finnish Channel 3 (now called MTV3)
had been airing TNG since September 1990 (but not continuously), but by
12/12/1992 they are finishing up season three and have no plans to continue
on with season four. Now, private cable channel PTV is airing the series on
Fridays.

France (1/8/97)
-====-
The series is bring shown on Canal Jimmy, a cable channel.

Germany
-=====-
The series is titled "Raumschiff Enterprise: Das Naechste Jahrhundert",
which, translated, means "Starship Enterprise: The Next Century". The
series is dubbed, and is shown in two consecutive half-hours, with a block
of commcerials in between. The title sequence is visually the same except
for the title of the show, which is stilled, and the words (in TNG-style
font) "Raumschiff (beat) Enterprise" placed on the screen, and "Das
Naechste Jahrhundert" at the botton using a left-to-right wipe".

The ZDF started over with season one on 1 March 1993, Monday through
Thursday at 1600 CET. They will air seasons 1, 2, and 3 (including a few
episodes that weren't aired last year). However, ZDF has lost the rights to
air the episodes, and the rights now belong to SAT1.

SAT.1 has begun showing Star Trek: The Next Generation now. The episodes
are shown Monday to Friday at 15.45 with 2 commercial breaks in each
episode. The episodes are repeated the next night at ca. 1.00. They will
definitely show 153 episodes (up to "Descent II") and perhaps even the new
episodes of the 7th season. Some characters will get new german voices from
"The Loss" on, because these episodes were never shown on the old station,
ZDF, and the old voices weren't available anymore. They report that with
the huge success of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine in the United States that it
won't be long until it shows up in Germany.

Changes from Season to Season
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
During the series' progress, changes are made to various areas to reflect
the show's evolution, or to fix some problems. Some of these changes are
noted below:

From Encounter At Farpoint (Pilot) to 1st Season
-==============================================-
   * Opening credits changed from actor's name only to actor and character
     name.
   * Troi outfit was changed from blue "miniskirt" to nonuniform dress with
     rank pips removed.
   * Troi's hair tied into tight bun.

From 1st to 2nd Season
-====================-
   * Wesley Crusher changes from shirt with rainbow strip to all grey
     uniform.
   * Worf is made permanent Security Chief (from red to gold uniform).
   * Geordi LaForge is made permanent Chief of Engineering (from red to
     gold uniform).
   * Geordi & Worf were both promoted to (full) Lieutenant
   * Ten-Forward is made as a permanent set.
   * Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) is added to crew as a recurring special guest
     star.
   * Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) is transferred to Starfleet
     Medical, and is replaced by Dr. Katerine Pulaski (Diana Muldaur).
   * Cmdr. Riker has grown a beard.
   * The Con and Ops chair were changed from the couch style chairs to
     regular style chairs.
   * Wesley Crusher was made Acting Ensign.
   * Worf wears a new, aluminum-like sash instead of the old, foil-like
     sash.
   * The stardates now advance in a more logical manner during a season
     instead of being somewhat random during Star Trek and the first season
     of Star Trek: The Next Generation.

From 2nd to 3rd Season
-====================-
   * The first portion of the opening title sequence is replaced from the
     planets to various views of the galaxy.
   * Dr. Katerine Pulaski (Diana Muldaur) was mysteriously replaced with
     Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden).

   * Title sequence was slightly rearranged, with the Star Trek: The Next
     Generation logo coming out of a video-tunnel like effect.
   * Captain Picard occasionally wears a blue-grey uniform with a red
     jacket. This was out of Stewart's request because he was getting bored
     with his regular uniform, and helped design the jacket. The jacket is
     made out of very soft suede and leather shoulders, and cost about
     $3,000 to make.
   * In the conference room, the wall relief containing the Enterprise
     lineage has been changed to some other pattern.

     Generation logo returning to the original effect seen in the first
     four seasons.

     Probert and Rick Sternbach) has been replaced by a piece of sculpture.

Stardates
~~~~~~~~~
After the random stardates in the original Star Trek, the powers that be
decided on a more logical way to determine a stardate. Thus, the following
came about.

EXAMPLE: "Captain's Log: Stardate 45076.3"

The "4" represents that the series takes place in the 24th century,
according to an original writer's guide, although Star Trek: Deep Space
Nine and Star Trek: Voyager will change that. It also has been noted that
1000 stardates pass with every year.

The "5" represents the season number of Star Trek: The Next Generation
without exception.

The "076" represents the portion of a season that advances during Star
Trek: The Next Generation.

The ".3" represents a portion of a day thereof.

During the pre-recorded sub-space messages and recorded logs of away teams,
both the current stardate and the current time (in 24-hour military format,
down to the second) are shown on the bottom of the screen. ("The Defector",
"Identity Crisis")

What is canon?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
According to various sources, this is what was considered acceptable, or
canon, for Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes, as well as po

   * Almost all of the original series (except for obvious conflicts)
   * All of Star Trek: The Motion Picture
   * Most of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Star Trek III: The Search For
     Spock, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, and Star Trek VI: The
     Undiscovered Country
   * All of the Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes
   * "Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual" by Mike Okuda and
     Rick Sternbach

The following is not acceptable:

   * Star Trek (The Animated Series)
   * Star Trek V: The Final Frontier
   * All Star Trek Novels (yes, even the ones Gene Roddenberry wrote)
   * All fanzines and fan written material
   * Mr. Scott's Guide to the Enterprise
   * Worlds Of The Federation
   * All FASA Material

Ranks and Insignia
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On Star Trek: The Next Generation, the following uniform colors represent
which division a person is in:

Medical Corps and Sciences - Navy Blue (?)
Security and Engineering - Mustard Yellow
Command and Navigation - Wine Red

Vice Admiral - Gold rectangle with three circle in it. (Redemption II and
Chain of Command I). (UV) Apparently, the number of circles corresponds to
the number of "stars" the admiral has.

Captain - Four solid gold circles

Commander - three solid gold circles

Lieutenant Commander - two solid gold circles and one empty gold circle

Lieutenant - two solid gold circles

Lieutenant (Junior Grade) - One solid gold circle and one empty

Ensign - One solid gold circle

- Two silver rectangles (worn by Kosinski in "Where No One Has Gone
Before")

Cadet - Various black stripes depending on group assignment. (First Duty)

NOTE: During seasons one or two, some of the pips were in silver.

NOTE: There have been inaccuracies with the pips and ranks, especially with
the rank of O'Brien.

According to Gene Roddenberry, there are no enlisted ranks in Starfleet.
However, in "Family", Sergei Rozhenko (Worf's foster father) mentions
something about meeting another Chief Petty Officer. Later on, in the same
episode, Sergei mentions that he, an enlisted man, managed to raise an
officer. Also, in "The Drumhead", the part-Romulan, part-Human medical
technician said that he was so anxious to get into space, he decided to
forgo the Academy and, instead, become enlisted. This will indeed
contradict what Gene has said.

In "Future Imperfect", some of the ranks in effect 15 years from season 4
are:

Admiral - Four Gold Bars

Captain - Four Silver Bars

The other ranks are based upon the "normal" TNG ranks. They are formed by
substituting a bar for a solid circle and a narrow bar for an empty circle.
The rank is part of the insignia/communicator.

Shuttlecraft
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following shuttlecraft, associated with the Enterprise, have appeared
in Star Trek: The Next Generation:

NCC-1701D-1 - "Sakarov" ("Unnatural Selection")
NCC-1701D-2 - "Goddard" (loaned to Scotty in "Relics")
NCC-1701D-5 - "El-Baz" ("Time Squared", "Descent, Part I")
NCC-1701D-5 - "Onizuka" (used in "The Ensigns of Command")
NCC-1701D-5 - Feynman ("The Nth Degree")
NCC-1701D-6 - ("Coming of Age")
NCC-1701D-7 - "Onizuka" ("The Minds Eye")
NCC-1701D-9 - ("The Price")
NCC-1701D-12 - "Pike" (destroyed in "The Most Toys")
NCC-1701D-13 - (crashed on Vegra II in "Skin of Evil")
- "Fermi" (Destroyed - "Rascals")

Other shuttlecraft from other ships....

NCC-2544-10 - (shuttle from USS Repulse, "The Child")
NCC-45167 - "Cousteau" (from the Aries, "Identity Crisis")

   * In "Unnatural Selection", Data states explicitly that he is fully
     trained to pilot all current Federation vessels, including auxiliaries
     (namely Shuttlecraft). We've also seen Ro, Riker, Picard, Wesley,
     Geordi, and Worf fly shuttles, but Data seems to be the crew's
     "driver."
   * In the episode "Power Play", Chief O'Brien mentions that some of the
     shuttlecraft are equipped with transporters, as demonstrated earlier
     with "The Best of Both Worlds - Part II".

buffer is recycled and the rematerialization subroutine is disabled so that

Scotty is surprised that Kirk got the old ship out of mothballs to rescue
him.

Diana Muldaur, a guest star on Star Trek episodes "Return To Tomorrow" as
Dr. Ann Mulhall and "Is There In Truth No Beauty" as Dr. Miranda Jones,

Enterprise Exceeds Warp Limits
-============================-
The Enterprise is able to only achieve Warp 9.5 "with extreme risk"
(Encounter at Farpoint). However, there have been various times when this
'speed limit' has been exceeded.

nine times while in command of the Enterprise. While it was not directly
specified what the nine violations were, these are believed to be the
episodes containing these violations:

8. Justice - In order to save Wesley from the death penalty for
(accidentally) violating one of the Edo laws.

14. Angel One - The crew barely managed to save the survivors of a
Federation ship from death for trying to change the society of Angel One.

41. Pen Pals - Data communicates with a girl whose planet was slowly
self-destructing.

44. Up the Long Ladder - Picard essentially forced the clone race to live
and breed with the Bringloidi, despite the strong resistance of the clone
race and the fact that this would completely destroy the non-sexual nature
of the clone race.

50. The Ensigns of Command - The Enterprise manages to delay a Sheliak
vessel from destroying a Federation colony on Tau Cygna Five, even though
the planet is part of the Sheliak Corporate.

52. Who Watches the Watchers - The Enterprise treats a Mintakan person for
serious injuries as a result of a Federation observation post's cloaking
device's failure, ending with that race believing Picard was a god.

60. The High Ground - The Enterprise engages in a commando raid in order to
rescue Captain Picard and Beverly Crusher on a warring world.

80. Legacy - The commando raid might have radically changed the balance of
power on the planet.

89. First Contact - The Enterprise contacts a planet in order to rescue
Commander Riker.

Saucer Separation
-===============-
The TNG Enterprise, being a starship carrying families, has the ability to
separate into saucer and warp drive sections in case of an emergency
situation. When separated, the saucer section is capable of only impulse
speed, while the warp drive section turns into a formidable battle machine.

1. Encounter at Farpoint - While Worf takes the saucer section to Farpoint
Station, Picard takes the warp drive section to meet up with the Q entity.

21. Arsenal of Freedom - Geordi takes the Warp Drive section in order to
destroy the defense device on Minos, while Chief Engineer Logan takes the
saucer section to safety.

75. Best of Both Worlds - Part II - In order to retrieve Locutus/Picard,
the Enterprise separates into two sections, with Riker in charge of the
Warp Drive section, and Cmdr. Shelby in command of the saucer section.
While the Borg attack the warp drive section, the rescue shuttle with Worf
and Data launches from the saucer section.

Part of the reason that we didn't see more saucer seperations was due to
budget constraints.

Time Travel
-=========-
24. We'll Always Have Paris - Dr. Paul Manheim's time experiment causes
small loops to occur in time.

39. Time Squared - Due to a strange energy vortex, a duplicate Picard from
the future arrives on a shuttlecraft

63. Yesterday's Enterprise - A worm hole is created, causing the
Enterprise-C to travel through time.

67. Captain's Holiday - Two Vorgons travel from the 27th century to get the
Tox Uthat.

82. Future Imperfect - Riker thinks he's in the future.

109. A Matter Of Time - Berlinghoff Rasmussen, in the 22nd century, steals
a time machine from a visiting time traveler from the 26th century, and
uses it to visit the Enterprise and steal some devices to "invent" later
on.

118. Cause and Effect - The Enterprise and the Bozeman gets caught in a
time loop. For the Enterprise, it was for around 17 days. For the Bozeman,
it was either caught in the loop for around 80 years, or simply shot
forward in time about 80 years.

126. Time's Arrow - Upon discovery of Data's head on Earth, the crew of the
Enterprise travel to a planet. In order to see the aliens/shapeshifters,
Data constructs a phase inverter, and, in the process, manages to travel to
1893. At the end of part one, Picard, Riker, Troi, Dr. Crusher, and Geordi
walk into the time vortex, and end up in the 19th century, although they
did manage to get back into the 24th century, and accidentally sending
Samuel Clemens to the 24th century before returning him to the 19th
century.

141. Tapestry - "Q" takes Picard back to his days after graduating from the
Academy.

151. Timescape - An alien creature on a Romulan ship causes time to stand
still in order to save it's young.

163. Parallels - Worf passes through a time eddy, and traverses through
several timelines.

173. Firstborn - Alexander from the future comes to the present to change
himself and his own personal history.

177. All Good Things - Captain Picard, thanks to Q, has Picard jumping from
present, to seven years previous, to twenty years in the future.

Also, the Traveler ("Where None Have Gone Before" and "Remember Me") could
be considered a time traveler. Maybe.

The Walking Dead
-==============-
Several times during the series, a major character has died, only to be
saved at the last minute. Some of these episodes include:

10. Hide and Q - Worf and Wesley get impaled by soldiers.

39. Time Squared - The Enterprise is seen being destroyed.

70. The Most Toys - Data is believed to be dead by the crew.

73. Transfigurations - Worf falls down in the shuttle bay, only to be saved
by John Doe.

116. Ethics - After a barrel crashes on Worf back, Worf dies during an
experimental surgery. However, his "redundant" body organs kicked in at the
last minute.

118. Cause and Effect - A collision with a starship causes the Enterprise
to explode, killing everyone on board, and causing a time loop in which the
Enterprise a collides with another starship, killing everyone on board,
causing a time loop...

129. Man of the People - Deanna is killed in order to stop an ambassador
from passing his evil emotions to another empathic person.

156-157. Gambit - Captain Picard is believed to be dead.

Wesley Saves The Day....
-======================-
3. The Naked Now - Wesley modifies a tractor beam into a repulser beam to
push the Enterprise away in order to give Data the extra time needed to
reinsert the chips.

traveler is phasing.

9. The Battle - Wesley discovers the Ferengi transmissions which are
affecting Picard.

12. The Big Goodbye - Wesley fixes the holodeck because his mother is in
there.

13. Datalore - Wesley realizes that Lore is impersonating Data

giving the ship the necessary power to "save the day".

60. The High Ground - Wesley comes up with a way to track the dimensional
shift of the terrorists.

72. Menage a Troi - Wesley identifies a signal as resembling a Betazoid
gong, helping to save Lwaxana Troi, Deanna Troi, and Riker from the Ferengi
ship.

83. Final Mission - Wesley is able to get past the guardian of the well and
get water for Captain Picard.

106. The Game - Wesley realizes the true purpose of the game and repairs
Data in time to awaken everyone from hypnosis.

....and Screws Up
-===============-
8. Justice - Wesley trips over a barrier, and nearly loses his life.

49. Evolution - Wesley, while pulling an all-nighter, leaves a container
open, causing some nanites to escape and wreck havoc on the ship.

79. Remember Me - Wesley's experiment causes his mother to be trapped in a
warp bubble.

119. The First Duty - Wesley's flight team performs an extremely dangerous
maneuver which results in a serious accident and causes the death of a
fellow team member. The resulting coverup causes Wesley to repeat a year at
the academy.

172. Journey's End - Wesley warns the colonists that the Federation may
beam them up, endangering the away team.

Who's Smoking?
-============-
1&2. Encounter at Farpoint - Q appears in 20th century military uniform
with an unlit cigarette in his right hand.

7. Lonely Among Us - Data smokes a pipe (much to the dismay of the rest of
the crew, especially Lt. Yar) as the first part of adopting his Sherlock
Holmes character.

12. The Big Goodbye - Picard is offered a holographic cigarette in the
police station. His coughing displays his displeasure.

45. Manhunt - Picard as Dixon Hill lights up again in full view, without
coughing.

61. Deja Q - After Q gets his powers back, he brings the Mexican band to
the bridge, and gives Riker and Picard a cigar, and after he leaves, he
becomes the smoke from Picard's cigar.

88. Clues - Guinan has a lit cigarette in a holder in D Hill's outer
office, doesn't take a puff. (Watch how the cigarette always changes to a
different length at each camera cut. A common problem in any movie where
smoking is portrayed).

126-127. Time's Arrow - Samuel Clemens chomps on a huge cigar. Suffers from
tobacco addiction withdrawal in the second part.

134. A Fistful Of Datas - Troi, playing the mysterious stranger, is seen
smoking in the sheriff's office.

Security Codes
-============-
11. 11001001 -

Emergency Evacuation
-++++++++++++++++++-
This is the emergency evacuation procedule while the Enterprise is docked
at a space station.

"Decks 2 through 4 to cargo transporters. Decks 5 through 10 proceed to
transporters 1, 2, 3, and 4. Decks 6 through 16 proceed to transporters 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Decks 17 through 28 proceed to transporters 11, 12, 13,
and 14. Decks 29 through 42 proceed to transporters 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and
20. This is not a drill. This is not a drill."

     finger scan.
   * Computer: "Recognized - Picard, Jean-Luc, Captain. Recognized - Riker,
     William T., Commander."
   * Picard: "Set auto-destruct sequence."
   * Computer: "Does the first officer concur?"
   * Riker: "Yes, set auto-destruct sequence...now."
   * Computer: "Auto-destruct will detonate in four minutes and fifty-nine

Note: While the auto-destruct can be activated in Engineering, it can only
be deactivated on the bridge.)

25. Conspiracy -

Secured Message Code
-++++++++++++++++++-
Capain Picard received a message that is labeled Code 47. Code 47 is a
Starfleet emergency frequency, and is for the Captain's eyes only.
Verification is as follows:

   * The screen shows the Starfleet logo with the words "United Federation
     Of Planets"/"Starfleet Command".
   * Computer: "This is an emergency communique. It is not to be discussed
     with fellow officers unless deemed absolutely necessary. There will be
     no computer record of said transmission."
   * Picard: "Understood."
   * Computer: "Proceed with voiceprint identification."
   * Picard: "Picard, Jean-Luc, Captain, USS Enterprise."
   * Computer: "Voiceprint verified."
   * [Communique begins]

Personal Verification on Ditalics Three
-+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-
Later in that episode, another verification procedure takes place in order
to verify that Picard has not been taken over:

   * Captain Picard beams onto Ditalics Three. He enters a mine, and is met
     with Captain Rixx, whose phaser is pointed at Picard. Captain Scott
     and Captain Keel join the group, with Scott pulling out her phaser and
     pointing it at Picard.
   * Keel: "Thanks for coming."
   * Picard: "This is some greeting, old friend."
   * Keel: "Tell me, Jean-Luc... where did we first meet?"
   * Picard pauses.
   * Rixx: "Answer the question."
   * Picard: "Calsetie three. It was a bar, and quite an exotic one as I
     remember. What do I win?"
   * Keel: "Do you recall the night you introduced Jack Crusher to
     Beverly?"
   * Picard: "You know full well that I hadn't met Beverly then, you
     introduced them."
   * Keel: "My brother introduced them."
   * Picard: "You don't have a brother. Two sisters, Anna and Melissa. What
     the hell is all this about?"
   * Keel nods to Rixx and Scott, who put away their phasers.
   * Rixx: "Apologies, Captain. We had to make sure you were really you."

58. The Defector -

Picard Secured Message Code

   * (Picard and Data are viewing information on Nelvana system)
   * Computer: "Captain Picard, priority one message from Starfleet coming
     in on secured channel."
   * Picard: "In my ready room. Computer, delay time."
   * Computer: "Two hours twenty-two minute delay from time of transmission
     at Starfleet Command on Lion Three."
   * Picard: (having entered his ready room) "Computer, key access Four One
     Two Mark Eight Zero Picard, Jean-Luc Starfleet Priority Code Gamma.

Did you know...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
...That Geordi LaForge is named after a real Star Trek fan named George
LaForge? George LaForge died from muscular dystrophy in 1975.

...That Denise Crosby originally tried out for the role of Counselor Troi
and Marina Sirtis tried out for the role of Security Chief Tasha Yar?

...That Gene Roddenberry's full name is Eugene Wesley Roddenberry, thus, in
creating Wesley Crusher, Gene used his own middle name and based the
character on what he wanted to be like when he was young?

...Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) did the special effect shots only for
"Encounter At Farpoint". However, they get credit in every episode because
of the extra stock footage for Enterprise fly-bys and such. Even ILM stock
footage isn't used much anymore, except when the Enterprise enters Warp.

...TNG is filmed in 35mm using Panavision cameras. The film is transferred
to videotape, and post-production is done on video.

...That William Riker and Deanna Troi is based upon Decker and Ilia from
Star Trek: The Motion Picture?

...That while "Skin of Evil" was aired after "Symbiosis", they were
produced in the reverse order. Near the end of Symbiosis, when the Ornarans
and Brekkians beam off, Denise Crosby is seen in the background, waving
goodbye as the doors close. (UV)

...LeVar Burton, when shooting began for "The Best of Both Worlds, Part
II", was in the hospital for emergency surgery. Colm Meany was used instead
for several scenes, and LeVar appeared in closeups during BOBW2 and was
absent for several episodes after that.

...LeVar Burton made his screen debut on Roots? He's not the only one.
Thalmus Rasulala, who played Captain Donald Varley of the USS Yamato in
"Contagion", played Omoro Kinte in Roots. Also, Ben Vereen, who is also a
Star Trek fan, also appeared on Roots.

...While filming "The Wounded", there was a scene in which Colm Meaney was
serving Keiko steak and potatoes for dinner. The potatoes had to get from
the spoon to the plate easily, while he continued with the dialogue, moved
around, served himself, etc. After about a zillion takes, it finally
worked, except that one small piece of potato bounced off the plate and
onto the table. So, Colm improvised, and quickly popped it in his mouth.
"Cut!" "What was wrong with that?" "Well, you popped that potato in your
mouth." "Yeah, so?" "Well, you can't do that see, this is a self-cleaning
ship." "I got to it FIRST."

...Hawking was on the Paramount lot for the video release of the film A
Brief History of Time. He was given a tour of the set, and when they
reached the bridge set, he began tapping out something he wanted to say
through his voice synthesizer. After about a minute, it said "Could you
take me out of my chair and put me in the captain's chair?" Now, Hawking
never asks to be taken out of his chair, so this was clearly a very big
deal. Someone did, and a few days later the idea of a quick cameo came up
for "Descent".

...That Star Trek: The Next Generation has made over $500,000,000 in
syndication and merchandising.

...That if you look closely at the Enterprise during the fly-by in the
opening credits, you can see someone walking past the windows. According to
Mike Okuda in the "Star Trek: The Official Fan Club Magazine" (#60), this
is Captain Picard.

..."The Child" and "Devil's Due" were originally scripts for the proposed
"Star Trek: Phase II" television series. The "Star Trek: Phase II" series
idea was scrapped, and instead, the sets were used for the shooting of Star
Trek: The Motion Picture.

...At the time of the filming of "Q Who", there were two visual
supervisors: Dan Curry and Rob Legato. They each had their own
specifications for the design of the Borg ship:

     Rob Legato - The Borg ship should be a ball with a trench of detail
     around the middle.
     Dan Curry - The Borg ship should be a cube that looked smooth at a
     distance.

As you got closer and closer, more detail would be revealed. (Dan had hired
Special Effects for this job).

Rob Legato team had some problems, so Special Effects got the job and built
the Borg ship. It took 14 modelers two weeks to finish the job. That is
nothing short of amazing when you consider that while the specifications
called for only one side finished, Special Effects supplied a Borg ship
that was finished on all sides. In order to achieve that level of detail,
F/X put everything in they could find, including R2-D2, toy soldiers,
plastic model "rails", and the F/X logo.

...The junkyard in "Unification II" consisted mostly of ships dragged out
from wherever Mike Okuda could find `em. Some of the models included:
models from the unmade "Star Trek: Phase II" series, models from ILM that
were never used, models of the Enterprise that didn't come out of the mold
right, and a very unusual looking Enterprise. Some of the models were
designed by Greg Jein and Robert McCall.

..."A Matter Of Time" was written partially because Robin Williams, a fan
of the show, wanted to appear. However, when the script was ready for
shooting, Robin was unavailable, so Matt Frewer was cast instead.

...That the shuttle Onizuka, which Data used in "Ensigns of Command", was
named in tribute to one of the Space Shuttle "Challenger" astronauts.

...Gene died at the same time the crew was filming "Hero Worship"?

...The only episodes when William Riker was called Bill was in "The Naked
Now" and "Haven"?

...Gates McFadden's stunts in "Remember Me" was done when she was pregnant
but she did not know about it until days later.

...For "Relics", it was impossible to re-use the original bridge, partially
because it was broken up and destroyed after the original series. Instead,
they used a captain's chair and helm/navigation console build by a Star
Trek fan named Steve Horch. The only other part that was built was from
about a foot to the left of the turbolift to the end of Scotty's
engineering station, as well as the railing that separates that from the
center of the bridge. Also, the Con and Ops chairs were look-alikes, and
are tilted back more than the real ones. The rest was a still from "This
Side of Paradise", not "The Mark Of Gideon". Also, the Aldebran Whiskey was
actually Hi-C Ecto Cooler.

...In "Booby Trap", the original name of the holographic scientist was to
be Leah Daystrom, who was the great-great-granddaughter of Dr. Daystrom
from TOS. However, after they cast Susan Gibney for the part, they changed
the name to Brahms, and only made several references to The Daystrom
Institute.

...In "Chain of Command", the thing inside the eggs that Picard and the
Cardassian ate were dead squids with little machines under them to make
them move.

...Andy Probert designed the Enterprise D, and owns the designs to the
Enterprise. Paramount is using his designs with permission. You can see
Andy in "Encounter At Farpoint", in the post-atomic court. Andy is the
spectator wearing "a giant tribble", actually a very large fur hat.

...The original Wright plane was named.....BIRD OF PREY!

...The original 8-foot model of the Enterprise that was built by Industrial
Light and Magic isn't used much anymore. For motion control work, the
4-foot model is much easier to use, is much more detailed, and, for far
away shots, it's easier to make it seem far away. The original 8-foot model
is used only for extreme closeups or for saucer separations. The 4-foot
model was built by Greg Jein in the third season.

...The title "The Dauphin" comes from the French term "Le Dauphin" used to
designate the male heir to the royal throne while the royalty was still in
place in France.

...The reason that you keep seeing a lot of the same faces on Star
Trek: The Next Generation, Civil Wars, and (I think) L.A. Law is that the
casting is all handled by the same casting director, Junie Lowrey-Smith
(not sure of this name either), who likes to reuse a lot of the same
actors.

...In "Deja Q", they had some problems filimg John DeLancie's nude scene.
The director had him in a jockstrap, but couldn't film around the
indentations it made in his skin because of the camera's perspective.
Finally, he told everyone who was offended by nudity to leave the set,
dropped the jock strap, and got the scene in one take. Incidentally, that
scene was filmed at 7 AM, and the mariachi band scene at midnight.

..."Family" and "Liaisons" are the only episodes in the original Star Trek,
the movies, and Star Trek: The Next Generation which has no scenes filmed
on the bridge.

..."Tin Man" was a life form borrowed from the "Wild Card" book series?

...In order to prepare for the episode "Chain Of Command, Part II", Patrick
Stewart watched tapes from Amnesty International. These tapes included
statements of those who had been tortured, and a long interview with a
torturer who talked about what it was like to be inflicting pain.

...Robin Curtis was originally slated to play the female terrorist in
"Starship Mine", but due to a conflicting shooting schedule, was unable to
play the part. She, instead, appeared in "Gambit" as a Romulan.

...Sidney Poitier was originally wanted for the role of Geordi LaForge,
but, due to a conflict in schedules, was unavailable. Ben Vereen, however,
was available, and this episode was the first time Ben and LeVar had worked
together since the mini-series Roots.

...The transporter effect is accomplished as follows:

  1. Fill a canister with water. Add glitter and shine a light through it.
     Stir briskly and tape.
  2. Film the scene, first with the actor, then without. (Or vice versa)
  3. Transfer the scene to tape, and use video technology to matte the
     glitter over the actor.
  4. Use a video wipe to `streak down' the glitter.

...The translation from "11001001" after Riker introduces them:

     Riker: (indicating) "Minuet. Minuet, Captain Jean-Luc Picard."
     Minuet: "Enchantee, comme c'est merveilleux de vous voir ici." / "Hi!,
     it's nice to meet you."
     Picard: "Incoyable! Vous etes Parisienne?" / "You are from Paris?"
     Minuet: "Au fond, c'est vrai nous sommes toutes Parisienne." / "Deep
     down we're all from Paris."
     Picard: "Ah, oui, au fond nous sommes tous Parisiens." / "Ah yes, deep
     down we're all from Paris."

...The translation from "Time's Arrow":

     Data (in English): "I am a Frenchman."
     Poker Player: "Ah, mes parents sont originaires de Boubonnais. Je suis
     ne a la New Orleans." / "Ah, my parents are from Boubonnais. I was
     born in New Orleans."
     Data: "Alors nous sommes presque freres. Je suis heureuz de vous
     connaitre." / "Then, we are almost brothers. I am pleased to meet
     you."
     Poker Player (in English): "Please sir..."

...According to a November 1992 issue of "California Business" article,
Paramount's annual first-run Star Trek: The Next Generation gross
advertising revenues are about $90 million, with production costs in the
$31.2-$36.4 million range. Net annual advertising profits are between $30
and $60 million, without even counting the $70 million+ in licensing and
affiliate station fees. Star Trek: The Next Generation, when it was in
first run syndication, aired in 217 markets, with a 99% national coverage.
Weekly viewership is in the 20 million range, bring in the most desirable
of demographics.

...That Star Trek: The Next Generation is on the list of shows endorsed by
the Viewers for Quality Television. Other VQT endorsed shows included
Cheers, Designing Women, LA Law, Life Goes On, Murphy Brown, Northern
Exposure, The Trials Of Rosie O'Neill, Law & Order, Quantum Leap, 60

35. The Measure Of A Man - When Riker is showing off Data's arm to the JAG
representative, there is a pad on her desk which lists Data's parts,
including "Nausican Valve" and "Totoro Interface". Also, it is noted that
part of Data's construction is made out of something called "Yurium".

37. Contagion - Another Galaxy Class Starship is mentioned: the USS Yamato.
This was originally the flagship of the Japanese fleet that fought in World
War II at both the Coral Sea and Midway before it was sunk by Torpedo
Bombers from an American carrier. Many years later, a Japanese Animation
series was done in which a battleship is reconfigured to become a starship
in order to recover something called the "Cosmo DNA", but was really
loosely based upon Jason and the Argonauts. This series was called Starship
Yamato. In the British version of Starship Yamato, the ship's captain,
Susumo Kodia, was named Jason Kodai. In the American version of Starship
Yamato, the series was titled Star Blazers, the captain was named Derek
Wildstar, but the ship was named the Argo.

43. Samaritan Snare - Picard mentions "Nausicans" in a conversation with
Wesley on the shuttlecraft.

Back To The Future
-================-
69. Hollow Pursuits - The anti-grav units contain a flux capacitor. Nothing
big, until you consider that the flux capacitor was a essential part of the
DeLorean/Time Machine.

Blake's Seven
-===========-
3. The Naked Now - Data quotes a lymrick that goes "There was once a lady
from Venus, whose body was shaped like a-" that may have originated on
Blake's Seven.

Buckaroo Banzai
-=============-
44. Up The Long Ladder - When Picard is looking at the list of ships trying
to find the Mariposa, another ship listed is the Buckaroo Banzai captained
by John Whorfin and built by the company that the red Lectroids had made.
The same company name was seen on the USS Hathaway (Yoyodyne Propulsion
Systems (of Grover's Mill, NJ, where Orsen Well's "War Of The Worlds" radio
play takes place :-) )

Computers
-=======-
15. 11001001 - The 11001001 is binary, and is converted to 201 decimal, or
hex C9. Under the Z-80 microprocessor series (the Z-80 was used in the
TRS-80 Model I, III, and IV, and for the sound processing in the Sega
Genesis), the C9, in assembly language, is known as "Unconditional Return."
In addition, on another machine language, 201 (decimal) corresponds to no
valid machine instruction at all, which translates to a NOP (No Operation
for 2 machine cycles).

Doctor Who
-========-
A cult British Science Fiction series which ran on BBC1 from November 23,
1963 to December, 1989, with a TV Movie that aired in May, 1996. The title
character is known only as "The Doctor", a time lord who travels through
time and space in a TARDIS (Time And Relative Dimensions In Space). The
TARDIS is bigger on the inside than on the outside, and can change outward
appearance, however, the Doctor's TARDIS, being a broken down Type-40, is
stuck in the shape of blue British Police Call Box. The Doctor himself can,
at point of death, regenerate into a totally different body and
personality.

26. The Neutral Zone - On the family tree of Clare Raymond, which is
recalled by Troi, there are references to various shows, including: W.
Hartnell m. P. Troughton, J. Pertwee m. T. Baker, and P. Davison m. C.
Baker, and J-L. Picard m. W. Riker. Other references include Gilligan's
Island and M*A*S*H. Also, the face pictured on the screen is Peter
Lauritson, one of the producers of Star Trek: The Next Generation.

73. Transfigurations - In the sick bay, against the wall, there is an
outline of the top portion of the TARDIS, upside down. Also, three roundals
can be seen against the wall. They show up again in several episodes after
this one.

117. The Outcast - Among the technical phrases used, "Reverse the polarity
of the neutron flow" was a phrase commonly used by the third doctor (Jon
Pertwee) during Doctor Who. (UV)

124. The Next Phase - One of the control panels on the Romulan Ship looks
somewhat like the TARDIS control console. (V)

Dirty Pair
-========-
A Japanese anime series where the two main characters, "Kei" and "Yuri",
are members of World Welfare Foundation. Their job is to take care of
problems that crop up. However, they usually leave the place in worse shape
than when they arrived, although it's usually not their fault. The series
itself has had original Star Trek in-jokes in it also.

25. Conspiracy - The topographical map of the planetary surface was a "very
shakey" drawing of Kei and Yuri. Yuri is on the right side, and Kei is
upside down.....

31. Loud As A Whisper - The conference table, "made to resemble indigenous
rock", had various markings on them, including "Kei" and "Yuri".

37. Contagion - The Iconian artifact has various markings on it, including
"Kei and Yuri", "Dirty Pair", "Gundam" and "Totoro."

37. Contagion - The Romulan ship that attacked the Enterprise was named the
"Harkonnen", which just happens to be the name of the family that attacked
the Atriedes family in the Dune series.

The Military
-==========-
1. Encounter At Farpoint - The military uniform Q wears is that of a Marine
Corps lieutenant colonel. And if you look closely, his rank, ribbons and
badges are all identical to those worn by Lt. Col. Oliver North when he
testified at the Iran-Contra hearings in 1986-87, just before "Farpoint"
went into production.

Money In The Future
-=================-
It should be noted that people are always offering to buy each other
coffee, etc. in Ten Forward, but this may just be a gesture, since we never
see anyone pay for anything. Also, they must be playing poker for some
stakes, just playing for chips would be meaningless.

1. Encounter At Farpoint - Beverly Crusher buys a roll of cloth, and has
her account on the Enterprise billed.

5. The Last Outpost - The Ferengi called the comm badges a shamefull use of
a precious metal, yet they said they have their own "matter-energy device".

23. Skin Of Evil - Worf mentioned that Tasha was favored in the ship's pool
in the upcoming martial arts tournament.

25. Conspiracy - The planet where the Starship Captains meet is Ditalics B,
and is said to be owned by Ditalics Mining Corporation, which may imply
something of the Federation's economic structure.

26. The Neutral Zone - Picard mentions that they no longer use money.

45. Manhunt - Picard, while on the holodeck running the Dixon Hill program,
goes to the bar to buy a drink. He, of course, forgot to bring money, and
the lady had to pay for the drinks.

47. Peak Performance - Riker is playing strategema against Kolrami. Worf
whispers to Riker that he has bet a "sizeable amount" on Riker in the
ship's pool.

56. The Price - There is a bidding war going on for the use of a wormhole,
and Picard mentions how much toll the Ferengi might charge if they get the
rights to use that wormhole.

62. A Matter Of Perspective - Dr. Apgar's reason for developing the Krieger
wave generator was to sell it to the highest bidder.

Religion In The Future
-====================-
52. Who Watches The Watchers - Picard is thought to be a god by the
populace.

85. Data's Day - In Data's log, a Hindu festival of lights is mentioned.

Robin Hood
-========-
In "Q-Pid", an obvious take-off of Robin Hood, the following crewmembers
played the following characters:

Picard -> Robin Hood
Riker -> Little John
Data -> Friar Tuck
Worf -> Will Scarlet. Is not a merry man!
LaForge -> Alan-a-Dale
Vash -> Maid Marian
Q -> The Sheriff of Nottingham

Shakespeare
-=========-
It is well known that Patrick Stewart is a Shakepearean actor from England,
and had a bit of a problem transitioning himself from stage acting to tv
acting in the first season. Patrick Stewart did a stint with the Royal
Shakespeare Company, and has also done productions of Shakespeare and led
acting workshops with a Univ. of California-based acting troupe known as
ACTER, of which he remains an executive member. Stewart also appeared in a
number of the BBC productions, including The Merchant of Venice and Hamlet.
Chances are, a good library would have videotapes of these. A few of the
crummier ones may also have copies. Patrick Stewart has also appeared for
several summers on the UC Santa Cruz campus with the Shakespeare Santa Cruz
group. Patrick Stewart played Shylock in a 1978 Royal Shakespeare Company
production of The Merchant of Venice at The Other Place. He has also played
a naked Oberon. He wrote an essay on the production which can be found in
Players of Shakespeare, edited by Philip Brockbank.

Anyways, several references to Shakespeare appear on Star Trek: The Next
Generation. Captain Picard is a fan of Shakespere, probably due to Patrick
Stewarts own enthusiasm. The title of the play and reference are in quotes,
with 4.2.74 referring to Act 4, Scene 2, Line 74.

1. Encounter at Farpoint - Picard says, "Kill all the lawyers!", which
comes from "2 Henry VI 4.2.74".

3. The Naked Now - Data says, "When you prick me do I not...leak?". This is
paraphrased from "Merchant of Venice 3.1.60-61".

10. Hide and Q - Q says, "All the galaxy's a stage," to which Picard
replies: "World, not galaxy, all the world's a stage." The reference is
from "As You Like It 2.7.139", with the entire passage from "As You Like It
2.7.139-165". Later on in the episode, Picard says, "Oh, I know Hamlet, and
what he might say with irony, I say with conviction: What a piece of work
is man! How noble in reason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving
how express and admirable, in action how like an angel, in apprehension how
like a god!" from Hamlet 2.2.304-308.

35. The Measure Of A Man - Picard inscribed a quotation from one of
Shakespeare's sonnets inside the cover of an antique of them he gave to
Data: "When in disgrace with fortune in men's eyes, I all alone beweep my
outcast state."

58. The Defector - At the beginning of the episode, there is a scene on the
holodeck where Data performs a scene from Henry V, when the King mingles
with his troops shortly before the Battle of Agincourt. The entire scene is
from "Henry V 4.1.84-157", although some lines were cut out. Originally
written for the King and three soldiers (Court, Williams, and Bates), the
author of the episode combined Court and Williams into one role,
represented here as Williams. Williams, incidentally, was played by
Shakespearean actor Patrick Stewart. Later in the episode, Picard quotes
from Williams' speech, which is from "Henry V 4.1.142-144".

65. Sins of the Father - The title comes from the "Merchant of Venice
3.5.1-2", with the entire passage from "Merchant of Venice 3.5.1-7".

70. The Most Toys - A quote of Sharespeare (1564-1616) from "Hamlet",
bookmarked by Data, catches Picard's eye when the volume is returned to him
after the android is presumed lost.

72. Menage A Troi- Picard sets about wooing Lwaxana Troi back from Daimon
Tog. In the process, he delivers a Shakespearean mish-mash from Sonnets
147, 141, 18, 116, and Othello 5.2.13-15.

79. Remember Me - The title is from "Hamlet 2.5.89-92 & 111-113" with the
entire passage from "Hamlet 1.5.89-113".

Star Trek
-=======-
3. The Naked Now - During the scan of records, we see a parrot wearing a
Starfleet shirt, complete with insignia, with nacelles, an obvious
reference to Gene Roddenberry. ("The Great Bird" = Gene) This same screen
also reappears in "Conspiracy".

99. In Theory - The line "Now would be a good time", spoken by Picard, is
completely reminiscent from Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, which, in turn,
was used by Kirk during "The Doomsday Machine". Also, while it is not be
visible in the actual show, someone on the production crew re-labeled the
shuttle pod "PONTIAC NCC-1701-D", in reference to the Pontiac commercials
that Patrick Stewart was doing at the time.

139. Aquiel - The name of the Klingon battlecruiser that meets with the
Enterprise is the Qu'vatlh (proper spelling, badly pronounced by Picard).
This is listed in the Klingon Dictionary on page 58 as one of the Klingon
curses.

[Unknown] - The race, Bolians, of which Mott the barber is one of, is
mentioned here. They are named after Cliff Bole, a frequent directer of TNG
and DSN. (Incidentally, Cliff Bole also directed several episodes of DSN).

Other
-===-
27. The Child - In this episode, Doctor Pulaski refers to "Cyano
Acrylates", which are the active ingredients for SuperGlue, as a possible
source of the Ikner radiation that was causing the plague samples to grow.

36. The Dauphin - In this episode, Daled 4 is a planet's name. Daled is the
fourth letter in the Hebrew alphabet, and has the numeric value of four.
(UV)

37. Contagion - The various views as seen through the portal include:
Toronto's City Hall and Nathan Phillip's Square (depicting the arches over
the reflecting pool/skating rink), and Toronto's City Council Chambers.

40. The Icarus Factor - The Star Trek: The Next Generation art department
had a field day putting in in-jokes. The mat has the chinese character of
"sei", or "star" (as in "starry sky". The two scrolls hanging on the walls
say, in Japanese syllabic characters (hiragana), "urusei yatsura", a pun of
"ususai yatsura" ("noisy neighbors" or "annoying neighbors", a Japanese
animation. Also, while lunging at Riker, Riker's father says (in a terrible
accent), "youroshiku onegaishimasu", literally saying "Please do me the
favor of being kind to me", but has the meaning of the English phrase
"Pleased to meet you." Various other markings include "Kei", "Yuri",
"Akira", and "Tonari No Totoro". In addition, the scrolls hanging on the
walls also say, "Ataru", "Lum", and "Uresai Yatsura".

67. Captain's Holiday - Riasa comes from the German word Reise, meaning
trip or journey.

80. Legacy - A label on a nuclear reactor says, "Remember, you can never
add TOO MUCH water to a Nuclear Reactor." Starlog #__ includes a complete
picture of the reactor, including some of the rules (some of them
hysterical)

94. Qpid - The scene where Worf smashes Geordi's lute, then says "Sorry" is
completely reminiscent of a scene in Animal House at a toga party. Also,
Princess Bride fans might want to note that the dialog during the sword
fight with Picard/Robin Hood, where he says "There is something you should
know... I'm not from Nottingham.", is reminiscent of a sword fight in the
movie where similar dialog is uttered.

96. Half A Life - One of the displays has the number "4077" in the corner,
a reference to M*A*S*H.

102. Darmok - The writers were playing around with the words in this
episode, with DARMOK, the letters reversed, becomes KOMRAD (comrade).
JILARD also becomes JLpIcARD. Also, Gilgamesh is based upon Gilgamesh (from
Sumerian lore), a character described as a combination of Solomon, Ulysses,
and Hercules combined into one. One of the important factors after his
friend's death is Gilgamesh's fear of death, although never playing a
factor in battle, results in his constant search for immortality. In one
manner or another, he comes very close, but always manages to miss.

126. Time's Arrow - The paper that Data picks up is the San Francisco
Register, which is same newspaper that Kirk and company saw being taken out
of the vending machine.

127. Time's Arrow II - Samuel Clemens mispronounces Hailey's comet. The
promounciation he uses comes from the 1950's, when "Bill Hailey and the
Comets", best known for "Rock Around the Clock" was popular. (UV)

130. Relics - With Scotty on board, there are plenty of references to the
old series. For instance, the "miracle worker" bit comes from Star Trek
III: The Search For Spock. The "It is green" bit comes from the original
Star Trek "By Any Other Name".

- Other in-jokes, albeit unseen, include: Shuttlecraft "Pontiac" and
"Indiana Jones" on operations board; crew quarters for Lt. Luke Skywalker.

Differences in Encounter At Farpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Currently, "Encounter At Farpoint" is being distributed in both a two-part
form and a two-hour movie form. The two-hour movie was shown as the first
episode of TNG, the repeat was shown as a two-part episode. Currently, the
stations that are showing TNG as a daily syndicated program have "Encounter
At Farpoint" as a two-part episode. Unfortunately, the two-part episode is
heavily butchered. Among the changes from the two-hour movie version:

   * The movie version starts out with the credits, the two-parter starts
     out with a teaser instead.
   * In the movie version, Riker sees what happens in two sections. In the
     two-parter, the second section is cut out.
   * The two-parter had the rejoining of the saucer section with the warp
     drive section being severely edited.
   * A section where Picard is talking to Dr. Crusher about Wesley is cut.
   * A scene where Geordi talks to Dr. Crusher about his VISOR was moved to
     part two. It appeared in the first half of the movie version.
   * Some of the audio was changed, and somewhat "sweetened" (Mike Brown
     term), in the two-part version.

To add additional confusion, Paramount has officially retired the two-hour
movie, and has made available for the videotape and laserdisc series an
unbutchered two-part episode of "Encounter At Farpoint."

Operation SNAFU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NOTE: A (UV) means that I haven't verified the SNAFU, (V) means verified.

Data Using Contractions
-=====================-
In "Datalore", Lore says that there are differences between him and Data,
among them, the ability of Lore being able to use contractions, while Data
couldn't. Yet, in "The Offspring", Data says that he "hadn't quite
mastered" contractions. It appears that Data can use contractions, as the
following shows indicate . . . . .

1. Encounter At Farpoint -

   * At the beginning of the "post Atomic-horror" courtroom, when Q enters,
     Data says, "At least we're acquainted with the judge, Captain."
   * When Data is asked by a very familiar "Admiral" if he is a Vulcan,
     Data replies, "No sir, I'm an android." (Entire Episode-V)

3. The Naked Now -

   * In the teaser, Data says, "Captain, what we've just heard
     is...impossible."
   * During act one, while on the science vessel, Data says: "Correction,
     sir.. that's blown out." instead of "that is".
   * After being examined by Dr. Crusher, Data says "I'm already listed in
     several bio-mechanical texts."
   * After Picard orders Yar to the sick bay, Yar asks "Did he say when?",
     to which Data replies "I'm sure he meant now." In this same scene,
     "Chronological age, no. I'm afaid I am not...." (Entire Episode-V)

4. Code Of Honor -

   * After telling the joke about kiddlelies (?), which contains two
     contractions, Data says, "I've told 662 jokes."
   * On the planet, where Data and Geordi have beamed down to examine the
     weapons to be used in the fight, Picard speculates as to the use of a
     number of metal lengths in the yard. Data answers at some length as to
     their possible uses, and is cut off by Picard - Picard: "Thank you,
     Data". Data: "You're welcome, sir."
   * Back on board the Enterprise, Data is briefing Riker as to Picard's
     plan. Data: "I'm here to brief you on what he wants."

5. The Last Outpost - During the conversation with Sentry, Data clearly
said "I'm afraid not." (UV)

6. Where No Man Has Gone Before - After they shot out of the galaxy and
were looking at all the nice special effects outside, Data said something
like, "It's beautiful". (UV)

13. Datalore - This episode is quite surprising, since this is one episode
which they should have been extra careful about using contractions.

   * In the teaser, in response to Tasha's query about holding the memory
     of over 411 people, Data responds, "Actually, I'm quite efficient in
     some basic human information."
   * In act one, on the way to the place where he was found, in response to
     Tasha's query about the colonist's memories, Data replies, "I've
     always felt that it was done hurriedly, but I know little more."
   * In act two, in a conversation with Chief Argyle, Data says, "I've been
     most anxious to hear the Chief Engineer's opinion, Mr. Argyle."
   * In the final act, after the fight with Lore, Picard asks Data if he's
     ok, in which Data replies, "Yes Sir, I'm fine." (V)

20. Heart of Glory - (UV)

29. Elementary, Dear Data - When Data and Geordi are just about to confront
Moriarty for the first time, Data notices some scratches near Moriarty's
secret entrance and he asks, "What's this?" (UV)

64. The Offspring - In the Captain's quarters, after Picard answers Data's
question about Admiral Halftel having children, Data replies, "I'm forced
to wonder how much experience he had as a parent when his first child was
born." (V)

82. Future Imperfect - The future Data uses a contraction.

99. In Theory - When entering Jenna's quarters, Data recites several
phrases with contractions, including "Honey, I'm Home" and "You don't tell
me what to do! You're not my mother!" - a clear contradiction of the
no-contraction rule. However, he was running a program in which he was
simply reciting various phrases couples use, and he was saying them in a
different tone of voice than usual. (V)

135. The Quality Of Life - Data clearly states "The transporter controls
are not malfunctioning. I've locked out the controls."

Other
-===-
Opening Credits (1st & 2nd Season) - During the opening sequence, the
graphics show a departure from the Sol system, beginning with Earth with
the sun in the background, and featuring fly-bys of Jupiter and Saturn.
During this sequence, the camera pans right, and we see sunlight off the
left side of Earth and Jupiter, but the right side of Saturn, indicating
that Saturn is backlit. (UV)

Opening Credits (From Third Season On) - During the opening sequence, at
the end of the planets, watch closely the starfields. The stars go in two
completely different directions.

1. Encounter at Farpoint - The computer, giving Riker directions in order
to meet Data on the holodeck, tells him the holodeck is the next door on
the right. However, Riker turns left and walks into the holodeck. (UV)

3. The Naked Now - When Troi finds Tasha in her quarters, affected by the
intoxication disease and trying on Troi's scarves, she and Tasha hold hands
as Tasha tries to grab a scarf from Troi. The camera switches views between
Troi and Tasha as they face each other. When facing Troi, Troi is holding
Tasha's right hand with her right hand. When facing Tasha, she is holding
Tasha's right hand with her left hand. Also, in one of the views, they are
holding a scarf, but not in the other. The rights and lefts may be off, but
there is definitely a screw-up in the scene. (UV)

4. Code Of Honor -

   * While on the planet, watch Deanna's arms. In the group shots, Deanna's
     arms are at her sides, while, in the close-ups, her arms are behind
     her back. (UV)
   * During the fight with Yareena, Yar's weapon is on her left hand.
     However, when Yar beams up with Yareena, the weapon moves to her right
     hand. I hate to think what else could be rearranged during transport!
     (UV)

9. The Battle - The Ferengi Daimon raises the shields on the Stargazer,
which should prevent transport, yet, right after raising shields, the
Daimon beams off the Stargazer.

10. Hide and Q - Shortly after Riker and the bridge crew are teleported to
the planet by Q, Data's rank insignia are wrong. He's suddenly a LtJG for
about three minutes. (UV)

13. Datalore -

   * Upon beaming down to the planet's surface, Commander Riker gives the
     stardate as 4124.5. A little later, Captain Picard gives it as
     41242.45. (V)
   * The glass of champagne Lore pours for Data goes flat immediately
     before Data picks it up thanks to the time that passed between the
     filming of the scenes. You can see it during the traveling wipe. (UV)

23. Skin Of Evil -

   * When Riker is being pulled into Armus, the away team runs towards
     Armus. However Geordi drops his phaser into Armus. When Captain Picard
     beams onto the planet, the away team is standing around calmly, and
     Geordi's phaser is back in his pocket. (Either the phaser didn't get
     THAT dirty, or they beamed down another one quickly) (UV)
   * The computer-generated picture Worf is looking at within the first
     minutes of "Skin of Evil" is the very same one you can see twice
     later: It contains already this graph of Armus' energy-level (or
     whatever it's meant to represent) with the same ups and downs Troi is
     causing much later in the show!

25. Conspiracy - At the beginning of the episode, while Picard is asleep,
Riker tells LaForge to increase speed to Warp 6. Laforge replies, "Aye Sir,
full impulse."

29. Elementary, Dear Data - Geordi asks, "What's wrong Data?" Data gives
him the page. Geordi says, "Data this is impossible," and he flips the
paper over so that it faces the camera. At this point we see the drawing
right-side-up, which means that Geordi was looking at it upside down. (UV)

31. Loud As A Whisper - Data has learned sign language and is now
interpreting what the mediator is saying. Data quotes the mediator as
saying "My friends have died" or something like that, before it is even
signed. (V)

35. The Measure of a Man -

   * In the first third we see the Enterprise circle this spinning
     spacestation, but then, when Picard meets this woman the first time,
     they stay at the window and you can see the moving Enterprise in front
     of motionless stars. (UV)
   * Data is shown bending a metal bar. However, the metal bar that Riker
     places on the JAG officer's desk is not bent in the same manner. In
     addition, the speed at which the bari is bent should have produced
     plenty of heat.

36. The Dauphin - There is a scene where both of the aliens have changed
into monsters. First the nanny changes to attack Wesley, then the girl
changes. There is a cut, and you see both monsters from a side view. The
girl-monster stands in front of a mirror, but you don't see a mirror image.
The monsters change back to the human forms and you still cannot see the
mirror images. At this time there is a cut again, but you see a similar
view of the room and now you can see the mirror image of the girl in the
mirror. At the time they copied the monsters on the film, they didn't
recognize that there was a mirror in that room.

38. The Royale -

   * The surface temperature of the planet is less than absolute zero by
     six degrees Celsius. Also, after they beam the piece of the ship out
     of orbit, O'Brien and Riker pick it up with their bare hands (coming
     from space, it should have been close to zero Kelvin itself).
   * After beaming down, they then scan the atmosphere to see if it's safe
     to breathe. (V)

42. Q Who -

   * Q snaps with his fingers to send the Enterprise back to the starting
     point. The ship then turns around to the left. But look at the view of
     the stars on the screen: they move from right to left. This is the
     wrong direction. (UV)
   * Worf shoots Borg #1, who falls to the ground, his left arm sprawled
     over his head and his right leg bent in an awkward position. The
     camera switches to wide-angle, and in that instant the dead Borg
     changes his position. (UV)

43. Samaritan Snare - Wesley opens a communications channel and says that
Shuttle #2 is ready for takeoff. However, in the following scene, when the
shuttle is seen powering up, there is a "01" on the outside of the shuttle.
Oops. (UV)

44. Up The Long Ladder - When Riker and his team are overpowered in the
clone Prime Minister's office, Riker is rendered unconscious by a phaser
set to stun. As he is being dragged off-scene, you see him look up at the
camera just as he thinks he is out of the shot. (UV)

46. The Emissary - Data is playing poker at the start with the bridge crew.
The stakes are being raised as they go around the table. Gerdie folds, Dr.
Pulanski sees and raises by pushing a stack of coins onto the pot. Long
shot: small pot, no stacks. Close up: pot with 3 stacks of coins. Number
One sees and moves another stack into the pot. Long shot: original pot, no
stacks of coins. Worf wins with 3 aces. Any gambler keeps an eye on the
pot; seems the director of TNG doesn't. (UV)

55. The Enemy - Picard says to Tomaluk that he will be escorting the
Romulan ship to the Neutral Zone. Yet, in the closing shot, the Enterprise
and the Romulan Ship take off in two different directions. (V)

56. The Price -

   * When the Ferengi Daimon talks to Picard about putting photon torpedoes
     through the worm hole, he says, "Casualties of war, Captain", however,
     his mouth looks as if he is saying "Picard." (V)
   * When Troi and someone is having dinner, at one point, one of them
     lifts up a fork and takes a bite, without anything on the fork. Must
     be a tasty fork! (UV)

59. The Hunted - At the end when the prisoners show up, Danar tells the
leader to shoot. Danar shoots the wall behind him and it blasts a hole in
the wall. Later scenes show the wall to be undamaged. (UV)

63. Yesterday's Enterprise - At the end of the episode, Geordi talks with
Guinan. However, he is wearing an open neck uniform with black cuffs from
the alternate timeline. (V)

65. Sins of the Father - The sound effects people must have fallen asleep
every time someone got slapped. (V)

67. Captain's Holiday - Picard is giving Vash the shovel with the handle
pointing towards Picard. Switch to a far shot and the handle is now
pointing to Vash.

68. Tin Man - The Enterprise and the Romulan ship are thrown far away by
Tin Man. Wesley said that thev've been thrown "3.8 billion kilometers
away". A couple seconds later, the sun goes nova, and they all saw it on
the viewscreen. Unless the viewscreen is supposed to have some sort of
sensor mechanism that relays events faster than the speed of light would
bring the view in, they shouldn't have been able to view the star going
nova for three and a half hours (assuming the US definition of "billion"):

   3.8E9 km * 1000 m/km
[  --------------------  ] / 3600 s/min = 3.52 hours
         3E8 m/s

70. The Most Toys - When Data is talking to the Enterprise at the start of
the episode, he says, "Level 1 precautions for incoming material remain in
effect." But when Geordi and Wesley are playing back the tapes later, we
hear, "Level 1 precautions remain in effect." Selective recorder? (UV)

71. Sarek -

   * The music recital in this episode contained several errors. First, the
     quartet seating is towards the audience, not toward each other.
     Classical music was originally developed with the performers facing
     each other in order to get visual cues. Performing in front of the
     audience did not come about until much later. Second, the Allegro is
     by Brahm's, not Mozart. Third, the Allegro is a sextet, not a quartet.
     (UV)
   * Geordi and Wesley are setting up this pool, and Wesley says that the
     temperature is 150 degrees celsius, which is 302 degrees Farenheit.
     However, there was no obvious radiant heat because Geordi and Wesley
     stand close to the pool and peer inside. (UV)

75. Best of Both Worlds, Part II - As the Borg Ship is shown warping
towards the Saturn, the lighting on the planet is from the right, and the
Borg ship arrives on the screen from the right, which would indicate that
the ship is coming from the same direction as the sun... kind of a
round-about way to get to the Earth, eh? (UV)

76. Family -

   * Jack Crusher is shown not wearing a communicator pin), then they show
     him again and a comm badge has magically appeared. (UV)
   * At the end of the episode, there is a scene of Picard's young nephew,
     Rene, sitting under a tree and gazing up at the stars (presumably
     imagining following in his uncle's footsteps). Appearing clearly in
     the middle of the sky is the constellation Orion. But while the
     episode appears to be set in the summer months, Orion is only visible
     in the early evenings in the dead of winter. Either the 24th century
     terraforming teams have conveniently rearranged Earth's seasons (after
     all, they did make France look a lot like the Sonoma Valley), or the
     post-production people goofed up.

77. Brothers - The code which Data gives to lock the Enterprise computer
system differs between the spoken version and the version displayed on the
screen. (See Security Codes) (V)

78. Suddenly Human -

   * When Jeramiah (?) sits down in 10 forward to have a banana split, he
     is on Wesley's left. Then when Wesley get hit by the ice cream, it
     comes from Wesley's right. (UV)
   * Near the end when Picard brings Jeramiah (?) onto the bridge, we don't
     hear the sound effect of the turbolift doors opening. (UV)

79. Remember Me -

   * Beverly asks the computer to show her "the Universe". The computer
     then puts out a drawing of the Enterprise that is cropped with a
     sphere with the portion of the saucer section with the bridge cropped
     off. (UV)
   * In the final act, when Wesley and the Traveler are entering the
     equations into the computer, watch Wesley's hand. He closes his eyes,
     and then places his hand on the case, about three inches below the
     entry pad. While he is making his entries, his hand starts moving up,
     while the sound effects people keep making the sounds in time. (V)
   * Dr. Crusher enters the turbo lift, in the last act, and ask to go to
     Engineering. The computer refuses and she says to go anywhere on Deck
     36, and the turbolift then goes. The lights of the turbo lift then go
     down, indicating the lift went up from the bridge. (UV).
   * When everyone has disappeared and Bev comes off the turbolift and down
     onto the bridge, the cameraman/equipment can be seen in the reflective
     glass/mirror to the left of the lift. (UV)

80. Legacy - During the card trick with Data, Riker's hand keeps on
changing position during the trick when the camera switches. (UV)

81. Reunion -

   * After K'Eyhlar dies, Alexander runs away. Worf lets out his primal
     scream. Then, we see her body being lowered to the floor. As she is
     finally settled, her eyes flutter open and closed several times (as,
     presumably, the actress, Suzie Plakson, "gets her bearings"). Also
     notice that her head is facing towards her left. However, when her
     body is shown full-on from the perspective of her feet (as Worf tells
     Alexander to "look at death, and never forget"), her head is facing
     slightly towards her *RIGHT*, and remains that way for the rest of the
     scene (a prime example of a scene being shot in several takes with the
     continuity person being asleep on the job). (V)
   * Dr. Crusher and her aide come from the bedroom, not from the corridor.
     Maybe they killed her... (UV)
   * When Worf kills Gowron near the end of the episode the camera shows
     Gowron's dead body and red blood coming from it. This is in conflict
     with Star Trek VI where the Klingons had pink blood. (UV).

87. Devil's Due - In the original Star Trek episode "Day of the Dove",
Captain Kang explicitly remarks that the Klingons have no devil. However,
in "Devil's Due", Ardra uses the guise of the Klingon devil, Fekhlar, a
creature that consumes the souls of cowards. (V)

88. Clues - Guinan has a cigarette in a holder, which changes length with
each camera cut...a common problem in any movie where smoking is portrayed.

91. Night Terrors - Check out the Brittain's visual log when the captain is
going mad, the name of the ship in the log is the USS Brattain, even though
the saucer decal reads USS Brittain. (UV)

93. The Nth Degree - In the holodeck scene where Troi attempts to talk
Barclay out of the neural net device he has concocted, the holodeck doors
don't close properly. A section of light is visible for a minute or more at
about waist level.

94. Qpid - Vash is writing this letter to Riker, then she folds it like
this:

          ______________________
         |                      |
     --- |   Riker              | ---
     |   |                      |   |
     |   |----------------------|   |       Sideview:
     |   |                      |   |
     ->  |   help               |  <-
         |                      |                    Text within
         |                      |                          -----------\
         |                      |        -----------------------------/
         |                      |
         |______________________|

So that the text is covered completely with the first fold. Then she places
the next fold over the first:

           _______________________
          |                      |
     |->  |                      | <-|
     |    |                      |   |
     |    |----------------------|   |               /------------
     |    |                      |   |               |   ------------\
     |--  |                      | --|               \---------------/
          |______________________|

Then, when Q enters and finds the letter, he just opens the second fold,
but he is holding the letter *upside down*! He starts reading even though
the words are not visible to him, because the first fold is still closed.
And he knows that the letter is for Riker. Sure, Q knows everything, but
why did he have top open it at ALL then? :-) (UV)

95. The Drumhead -

   * After the first hearing with J'Ddan, Worf and J'Ddan leave the hearing
     room. The doors open, as they are walking though the doorway, the
     doors start to close, but hesitate, open back up and then close after
     they leave the doorway. Looks like someone pulled on the rope too soon
     :-) (V)
   * Also, Satie says that Captain Picard took command of the Enterprise at
     Stardate 41162. This is in error...it was 41152. (V)

96. Half A Life - Near the end of the episode, when Lwaxana Troi is
standing next to the mirror and then begins to walk away from it, for a
brief instant the boom from the mike is visible in the reflection. (V)

99. In Theory - In the teaser, Data finishes telling Jenna the reasons why
she broke up with Jeff. She and Data then close up the photon torpedo, and
she moves off to a control panel. On top of the torpedo rests a black,
hand-sized deviceamajig. Data stands up, holding some sensormajig in his
left hand. The scene then shifts to Data walking towards Jenna, and the
sensormajig is now in his RIGHT hand (with no indication that he ever
shifted it there), and Jenna is holding the deviceamajig she left on top of
the torpedo (with no indication that she ever went back to get it). (V)

101. Redemption II -

   * In part one of this story, Worf said that he would be serving on the
     Bortas. Yet, in this episode, he is serving on the Hectar, with no
     explanation about the transfer.
   * Picard says to Guinan that Yar died a year prior to Guinan joining the
     crew. However, "Skin of Evil" was the fourth to last story of the
     season, and Guinan is first seen in the second season premiere "The
     Child", suggesting only 3-4 months between the two stories.
   * Picard refers to the battle on Narendra III as taking place 24 years
     ago to Sela, and 23 years ago to Guinan. (V) But, of course, Guinan
     senses time differently...
   * When Worf is given his family name back the blood on the knife is red
     not pink as in Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country. (UV)

102. Darmok -

   * Due to a post production error, the phasers shot out of the photon
     torpedo tubes. (V)
   * The very last shot (from outside the ship) shows Picard looking out
     the windows of his ready room. You can see a reflection in the window
     of the stars moving. However, they are moving straight toward the
     window. The ready room on the port side of the ship. The stars should
     have been moving left to right (from our reflected view). (UV)

103. Ensign Ro -

   * When Ensign Ro takes off her jacket, her communicator is on her
     jacket. However, when she hands the jacket to the little girl, her
     communicator jumps to her uniform, with no action of putting the
     communicator there. (V)
   * Then, when Ro talks with the girl, we sometimes se shots taken from
     behind the girl, sometimes from behind Ro. On the shots taken from
     behind the girl, Ro is less crouched, I mean that her head is much
     higher compared to when she is filmed from behind her.

104. Silicon Avatar - In the second act, look closely at the tricorder that
Dr. Marr holds during the conversation between Dr. Marr and Data. During
the conversation, she has her tricorder open. She then closes it, then
reopens it, but holds the tricorder UPSIDE DOWN!!!! (V)

105. Disaster -

   * In the scene where Dr. Crusher and Geordi are evacuating all the air
     out of the cargo bay, Geordi hits the button that closes the cargo
     bay. The pushing of the button and resulting door closing are audible,
     even though sound doesn't travel in a vacuum. (Probably dramatic
     reasons)
   * When the ship starts shaking, they cut to Ten Forward, where the stars
     are shaking right along with the ship. (V)
   * While in the turbo lift, when Picard gives out the pips to the girl
     (whose name escapes me), look closely (actully it's fairly obvious
     once you notice it). Her collar has two small holes where the pips go,
     before the pips were put on. Either they punched some holes to make it
     easier to put them on (since the collar looks fairly stiff) or it's a
     product of having to do the shot in several takes. (UV)
   * In the last scene, Picard is leaving the bridge heading for his ready
     room, the door closes too early, and the sound comes too late. (UV)

106. The Game - When the crew are forcing Wesley to play the game, and
Riker is holding his eyes open, Wesley blinks. (V)

107. Unification I - When Dr. Crusher is examining Data in order to prep
him (and Picard) for Romulus, she asks if Data's ears are detachable, to
which Data says that they are not. Yet, in "Datalore", Data's brother,
Lore, is clearly shown without ears. A design change?

108. Unification II -

   * After Spock, Picard, and Data have knocked out the Romulan guards, and
     Spock has Sela at gunpoint, Picard has no gun in his hand. After a
     camera switch, Picard then holds a Romulan "disrupter pistol". A
     minute later, after a scene with the Enterprise, Picard is still
     standing in the same place, but with a Romulan "disrupter rifle". (UV)
   * After Data gives Sela the famous "Spock Pinch", and when Picard, Data,
     and Spock leave the room, look at the glass pyramid in Sela's office.
     There is a reflection of a cameraman chewing gum. (V)

110. New Ground -

   * Alexander states that he was born on stardate 42305. Unless the
     equivalent of 01000 stardate equals approximately one year, Alexander
     would be only 2 and a half years old.
   * The creature which Riker saves from the lab is obviously a hand
     puppet. (V)

112. Violations - Troi and Tarmin get into the turbolift on Deck 3. Troi
orders it to go to Deck 8. When she gets off, the doors close just in front
of the camera, clearly showing "Deck 3." (UV)

113. The Masterpiece Society - Geordi states that his VISOR covered the
range from 1 Hertz to 1 Terahertz. While this covers radio, microwave, and
far infrared frequencies, it does not cover near infrared, visible,
ultraviolet, x-rays, or gamma rays.

114. Conundrum -

   * While a record search is performed, Deanna's father was listed as
     "Alex". However, in "The Child", she named her child after Ian, her
     father's name. (V)
   * When MacDuff is talking to Picard in Picard's ready room, when Picard
     goes to the window, all you see in the window is the reflection of
     Picard and the room behind him (not the stars outside), then, when you
     see MacDuff, in the reflection, leaving the room behind Picard, when
     the door opens, you don't see the reflection of the bridge, you see
     stars. Oops! (UV)
   * After Riker's first love scene, a wide-angle-view-pan-to-closeup on
     the bridge can be seen at the very top of the screen, in the brightly
     lit area. (UV).
   * Shortly afterwards, in the same scene, MacDuff is walking around and
     up to the tactical station from his chair, and we can see his legs
     walk next to Worf's. The camera cuts to Worf, and we see MacDuff
     approaching Worf. (UV)
   * Beverly Crusher is listed in the crew manifest as a Lt. Cmdr, when her
     actual rank is Commander. (UV)

116. Ethics - When the barrel falls on Worf, a second barrel also falls,
and it's lid pops off. However, when Geordi runs over to Worf, the lid is
back on the barrel. (V)

118. Cause and Effect - The first time we see Picard in the Sickbay talking
to Geordi and Dr. Crusher, he is wearing his standard uniform, and states
he had a feeling of deja vu when he was reading. However, in the next loop,
he is shown wearing his grey uniform while reading in his ready room, and
when he's in Sickbay, he's also wearing his maroon jacket. (Also recall
that in the first loop, when he is talking to Beverly, he is wearing the
grey uniform. Thus, the sequence goes: grey -> standard -> grey).
Presumably, both instances of this scene happen at the same "time", and
since Picard's behaviour was not affected until Dr. Crusher contacted him,
why is he wearing the standard uniform in one loop, and the grey uniform in
the next loop? (V)

119. The First Duty -

   * About 10 minutes in Wes goes to the door. The long shot has him
     opening the door with his *left hand*. Cut to close up, and the door
     is being opened with his right hand. (UV)
   * About 40 minutes in. Wes is talking to [someone] in his quarters. From
     behind, his hands are in one position, and when we cut to the front,
     they're in another position, obviously different. (UV)

120. Cost of Living -

   * In the turbolift where Picard and Data got trapped, due to the metal
     parasites, look closely: Picard, in this scene only, is wearing only
     three pips. (V)
   * Picard is told that the inertial dampers had failed, after which he
     orders the Enterprise out of warp. If the inertial dampers had failed,
     they would have been splattered all over the bridge. (V)
   * When Lwaxana and Alexander are in the mudbath, Alexander is holding an
     edible glass with a bite in it. One shot shows the bite pointing to
     the right and another shot shows it pointing to Alexander's left. (UV)

122. Imaginary Friend - Data says something about a lower strand density to
the starboard side, and Picard tells him to move towards it, and the view
shifts to the exterior of the Enterprise turning left. (UV)

123. I, Borg - During the first time in the lab, Three of Five asks "Do I
have a name?" "I" should not have been used, it should have been "we".

124. The Next Phase -

   * One of things overlooked is an explanation of why Geordi and Ro are
     able to breathe or not be able to go through the floors. Oops. There
     is even a scene where Geordi's hand goes through a table, but another
     where a phased Romulan can sit in a chair that rocks when he gets up.
     (UV)
   * When the Romulan is fighting with Ro, and LaForge shoves him through
     the bulkhead, we see the Romulan exit the Enterprise facing us
     right-side up, but when they show him drifting away into the icy cold
     of space, he is facing away from us right-side up he's facing the
     wrong way as he's rotating! (UV)
   * Riker starts playing the trombone before his lips reach the
     mouthpiece. (UV)

126. Time's Arrow -

   * The paper that Data picks up is dated "Sunday, August 11, 1893".
     Unfortunately, August 11, 1893 was a Friday. (V)
   * During the episode "Clues", Guinan says she was late because she had
     trouble getting into her dress, yet, in this episode, she is seen
     wearing a dress. (V)

128. Realm of Fear - After 4 seasons, lt O'Brien has suddenly lost his
normal two pips, replaced by a single hollow pip. Other pip-problems
include lt Barclay's single/hollow pips swapping position, as well as
having two solid pips when in Troi's office. They probably felt that
Barclay needed to outrank O'Brien to be able to influence him.

129. Man Of The People - There were several snafus that occurred,
including:

   * In Engineering, when Geordi and Beverly were checking out the
     Biofilter logs from the Dorian, Geordi had two hollow pips and one
     solid, instead of two solid and one hollow.
   * When Riker and Troi walked out of Ten-Forward (the scene where Troi
     was wearing that revealing dress), they stepped right into a
     Turbolift. The sign on the lift's door said "08 Turbolift", indicating
     they were on Deck 8 instead of Deck 10.
   * Near the end, in Sickbay, when Beverly was reviving Deanna, Deanna's
     eyes fluttered open a couple of times, and then remained shut. (This
     is when she still looked old.) Although I couldn't make out an actual
     color, it was obvious that Marina didn't have her black contacts in.
   * Picard referred to transporter room 3 twice at the crucial time of
     beaming out the ambassador's aide? He told room 2 to be ready.
     Transporter room 2 was referred to throughout the episode. This is a
     relatively trivial point, but a stupid production error none the less.
     (UV)
   * Also, isn't it amazing how dead hair folicles can change color from
     grey to brown when Troi de-ages, isn't it?

131. Schisms -

   * When Riker sits down at Conn when the ensign is having trouble
     navigating, when we see his hands over the console, it is the display
     for Ops. It was also explained at the end of the episode that the
     experimenters had homed in on the Enterprise from Geordi modifying the
     sensors. Yet, Riker began experiencing his chronic insomnia days
     before Geordi made his modifications. (UV)
   * Worf notes that Lt. Haggerl had just returned to Deck 9, Section 17,
     yet, seconds later, Dr. Crusher wants a device brought to Deck 9,
     Section 19. (V)

133. Rascals -

   * The computer display in the classroom clearly shows "Classroom Seven"
     on the screen. Yet, when Picard meets Riker, he refers to Classroom
     Eight. (V)
   * When Keiko gets the coffee, when she picks it up from the replicator,
     it's in her left hand, yet, in the next scene, it's in her right hand.
     (V)
   * Amazingly, the clothing shrank, but not proportionally, and Guinan's
     hat and Ro's headband are perfect. (V)
   * When Riker dives to avoid a phaser blast, we *HEAR* the phaser, but do
     not see it.

134. A Fistful Of Datas -

   * When Data is being connected to the computer, look at his neck. You
     can see where the gold makeup ended. (UV)
   * When Pa Hollinder talks to the young Hollinder, and Pa turns, his hand
     gets "cut off" due to the video wipe. (V)
   * While Pa talk with Worf and Troi, take a look at the manniquin
     stand-in for Young Hollinder.

136. Chain Of Command -

   * The tunnels were underground, yet, they never once used a flashlight,
     and there was light down there. (UV)
   * When Worf opens up the door that was magnetically sealed, it opened
     inward like a normal door, yet, when they started to run out, the door
     slid closed. Trick door?

138. Ship In A Bottle -

   * When the book is tossed out of the holodeck, it got zapped
     immediately. This conflicts with "The Big Goodbye", in which the
     gangsters, when they walked out of the holodeck, they de-rezzed
     slowly.
   * In "Elementary, Dear Data", there was a sheet of paper which did not
     de-rez when Picard took it out of the holodeck. Moriarty must have
     made some programming boo-boos. (V)
   * When Picard walks into the holodeck he is wearing his open coat with
     the blue shirt, but he walks out wearing his one-piece red shirt.
     Either he changed his uniform inside the holo-deck and is wearing a
     holo-shirt (in which case his uniform top should have disappeared when
     he steps out of the holo-deck at the end of the episode) or they
     screwed up again! :-) (UV)
   * When they cut to a commercial break at the end of the scene where
     Moriarty tells Picard he has taken over the ship, Picard begins to say
     something as the screen fades. It's close to the end of the first half
     of the episode. (UV)

140. Face Of The Enemy -

   * When the defector ensign boards the Enterprise, he asks Riker to meet
     with Captain Picard. When Picard walks to that ensigns quarters, the
     defector addresses him as Commander as if Picard were a Romulan CO.
     (UV)
   * Troi is surgically altered to look like a Romulan, including the short
     hair style. When Crusher alters her back, she has long hair again. So
     Crusher can accelerate hair growth, the Romulan captor hid her hair,
     Troi wears a wig, or they messed up another scene!

142. Birthright, Part I - When Data first started painting, you could hear
his furious little brushstrokes against the canvas (whish whish whish!).
But when he stopped painting and stepped back to view his work, you could
still hear the brushstrokes (whish whish whish)! (UV)

143. Birthright, Part II - Worf states that Kayhless caused the oceans to
overflow with his tears. Slight problem: In Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered
Country, Spock states that Klingons have no tear ducts.

149. Rightful Heir - It is stated that there has not been a Klingon Emperor
for over 300 years. However, in "Sins of the Father", Worf's nanny states
that Worf's father was loyal to the Emperor.

150. Second Chances - Near the end of the episode Cdr Riker is rescuing Lt
Riker on the edge of the cliff. In one of the long shots, the stunt double
dressed as Lt Riker was wearing a Star Trek: Deep Space Nine gold and black
uniform tunic, not a Star Trek: The Next Generation tunic. When Lt Riker
then gets his next close-up, he's back in a Star Trek: The Next Generation
gold tunic. Somebody in the costuming department wasn't careful that day.
If it was one of the early Star Trek: The Next Generation uniforms, though,
it could have been bunched up around his shoulders (they tend to do that
when your arms are raised), so what the viewer sees is the black
undershirt. (UV)

151. Timescape -

   * As Troi enters sickbay for the first time, she scoots past two
     security officers in mid-stride just before they enter sickbay. Later,
     as she yanks Beverly out of the way and draw on the Romulan, no
     security guards enter the room (even though they were scant feet from
     entering and in the middle of a stride). (UV)
   * When Data, Troi and Picard returned to the Enterprise and set time in
     motion again, Picard was on the bridge. When time started forward
     again, Picard told Riker that he'd find Geordi on the Romulan ship and
     to beam him directly to sickbay. The Romulan ship is no longer around.
     (UV)
   * The runabout crew had just suffered a port engine shutdown, due to the
     effect of the time discontinuity bubbles. Picard tells Data that he is
     going to check the fuel consumption logs and proceeds to go to another
     part of the craft. We see a plate of aged fruit as Picard walks in.
     Notice his right hand as he enters. His fingers are curled inward,
     shielding his nails from our view. When he sits down at the control
     panel, he begins to touch the controls with the pads of his fingers.
     His extra long nails are already clearly visible, moments before he
     ever reached for the fruit. (UV)

154. Liasons - In the poker scene, when the Ambassador "stole" some of
Worf's chips, Worf stated that he saw him steal 2 of his chips, but the
cut-a-way shot clearly showed him taking 3. (UV)

157. Gambit II - Worf reports a hit on port nacelle. However, the phaser
blast was on the starboard nacelle. (V)

160. Attached - Funny thing, in both Dr. Crusher's quarters and Captain
Picard's quarters, the same idential painting are in both quarters. (UV)

161. Force of Nature - In "Phantasms" and several episodes previous, Data's
cat, Spot, is referred to as "he". Yet, in this episode, Spot is referred
to as "she", and, in "Genesis", is shown having kittens before turning
(temporarily), into a Iguana.

162. Inheritance - In one scene, Juliana is seen stepping onto the
transporter pads wearing heels, and arrived on the planet wearing flats.
(UV)

163. Parallels - In several scenes, Data is seen with having blue eyes
instead of the yellowish-grey eyes. Brent forgot his contacts! (UV)

166. Sub Rosa - In the cemetery, Beverly asks Deanna to go with her to the
house. Deanna agrees and they walk out of the cemetery. Then Picard begins
a discussion with the Governor of the colony. Towards the end of the
discussion, when the Governor is explaining about visiting the castle,
Deanna walks across the cemetery in the background. (She left with
Beverly.) The next scene shows Beverly and Deanna entering the house. (V)

177. All Good Things - It was stated that all three Enterprises fired the
Tachion beams. However, it was the Pasteur that fired the initial beam.

- Betazoid's and the Ferengi Mind: In "The Battle" and "The Price",
Deanna's is able to sense deception from the Ferengi, and later, used
against them. Yet, in "Menage A Troi", the Betazoid Ambassador says that
they are unable to read Ferengi minds, a fact later confirmed in "The
Loss". Data has suggested that this is due to the Ferengi brain separated
in four regions. It should also be noted that Portal was unable to read the
Ferengi mind in "The Last Outpost" because the Ferengi mind is somehow
shielded.

- In "Reunion," Gowron was prepared to offer K'Ehleyr a seat on the Klingon
Council for her assistance in getting Picard to quicken the pace of the
Rite of Succession. However, in "Redemption," he states to Picard that
females are not allowed to serve on that Council. He really wanted that
pace quickened.

              Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual

The "Star Trek: The Next Generation" Technical Manual (Pocket Books, ISBN
0-671-70427-3) is the complete technical guide to the Treknology used in
Star Trek: The Next Generation. It is written by Rick Sternbach and Michael
Okuda, who work in Star Trek: The Next Generation's Art Department. Among
their responsibilities include making sure that everything is consistent in
the technical department from show to show. However, they have been known
to clown around a little, and some of that clowning has shown up in the
technical manual. Such as:

7 - The line drawing of the Enterprise is the mirror image of what it
should be. Shuttlebay 3 (the wide bay) should be on the right hand side and
Shuttlebay 2 (the narrow bay). The descriptions, however, point to the
correct relative positions. This has been confirmed with the onscreen image
of the Enterprise and the other drawings throughout the manual.

11 - In the saucer section, right above the Captain's Yacht, there is a
duck. A half inch to the left and a little bit down, there is a mouse.
Slightly to the right of the mouse, there is a "Slippery When Wet" sign. In
the shuttle bay, there are three big shuttles, two small shuttles, and a
Porsche. To the right of the duck, about one inch, there is a DC-3 cargo
aircraft, and, in that same rectangle, there is a symbol of a woman and a
child (the symbol for Canada's "Family" rating for movies). Also, right
under the warp pylons, there is a registered trademark symbol. In addition,
there is an image of NOMAD on it's side, center of the saucer section,
forward. Interestingly enough, if you look at the ship diagram in
Engineering on the show, those exact items show up.

77 - One of the controls not seen is the "Infinite Improbability
Generator", a reference from the "Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy"

120 - The tricorder display shows "TR580 TRICORDER VII", a reference to the
old Radio Shack TRS-80's.

159 - One of the shuttle names is "Hawking"

In The Original Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In test screening of Star Trek: Generations, initial audience reaction was
negative towards the film. Some of the changed scenes include....

   * The opening sequence was as follows: Originally, interspersed with the
     wine bottle floating through space we see shots of Kirk "Space -
     Diving." He is free-falling through space, eventually coming into the
     atmosphere. Paramount nixed this as they didn't think that the idea of
     Kirk falling to earth with his butt on fire (that's where the heat
     sheilds are) would go over too well. The entire sequence was cut out.
   * Another scene that was cut out WHICH HAD FOLLOWUP dialog STILL IN the
     movie was the Geordi torture scene. Aboard the Klingon vessel, we hear
     Soran comment when asked `Did you get any information out of him' with
     "His heart wasn't in it." In the missing scene he puts some nanites in
     Geordi's heart so that he can stop it at any time to torture him. As
     well, once he is back aboard TE Beverly, in one of her two lines,
     mentions that there was some ` ... damage to the coronary artery ...'
     This again related back to the cut torture scene.
   * Kirk's death scene was as follows: Kirk and Picard arrive back from
     the Nexus. On the bridge over the canyon, we see Soran, then (from the
     feet up) Kirk. <minor dialog: `Who the (^%^ are you' > Soran turns
     around to see Picard. Kirk and Soran fight and with a tremendous punch
     Kirk knocks him over the railing to the rocks below. Kirk and Picard
     run to turn off the missle and everything's great, congratulations all
     around ... ZAAAAAP! A half dead Soran shoots Kirk in the back and each
     of them dies. This ending was NOT acceptable to the majority so the
     scene had to be re-shot to what we see in the present version.

Did You Know...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   * The original script included all the major characters from the
     original Star Trek to be in the opening sequences. Nimoy (Spock) had
     read the script and didn't care for it. Since he only had a couple
     lines of dialog he proposed to Paramount that he would be in the movie
     only if he could direct it; otherwise it wouldn't be worth his while.
     Paramount said NO.
   * Since Spock wouldn't be in the movie DeForest Kelly said it wouldn't
     make sense to have `the entire crew there and not have Spock.' Since
     he suffers from extreme arthritis and the fact that Spock would not be
     in the movie, it would be too painful for him to be in the movie. As
     we know, the only characters to appear were Chekov, Scotty, and Kirk.
   * Whoopi Goldberg was not going to do the movie at first; this was
     according to her agent. Paramount phoned up, asked if she would do it
     for $xx and were told straight out `No way, she's worth $$$$, forget
     it.' Well, when Whoopi heard about this and was talking with Paramount
     she basically said `What? Screw him, I'm DOING the movie!' Her basic
     motivation for this was that in the original script Uhura (Nichelle
     Nichols) was in there. She was sort of an inspiration/role model for
     Whoopi when she was growing up. When she came to realize later on that
     Uhura was NOT EVEN ASKED to be in the movie, she was extremely upset
     to say the least. It was a dream of hers to actually act with
     Nichelle; the original script called for Uhura to be the one to
     comfort Guinan after she was `rescued' from the Nexus.
   * A 24 foot model of the saucer section was pulled by a pickup truck
     across the ground and slammed into a sand-bank for the crash scene.
   * The horses that we see Picard and Kirk on are actually Shatner's!

                     Eugene Wesley "Gene" Roddenberry
                    August 19, 1921 - October 24, 1991

He created a legend which continues on today, creating a show that has
helped believe that there was a future worth living for. He showed us that
space is not just for space battles, but for learning new ideas and ways of
thinking, and, indirectly, has done more for civil rights and the space
program than Martin Luther King, Jr. and John F. Kennedy. Gene will be
missed, but will not be forgotten.
