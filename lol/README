Basically, I froze the List of Lists on February 8th, 1997, ported the
List of Lists over to plain text files ... and made them available on
the FTP server.

Please note that the HTML version
	[ http://www.deepspacefranchise.com/lol/ ]
will now be the master document for the list of lists, and that ASCII
versions will be exported occassionally.

[ The Star Trek Movie List of Lists has been broken up into TOS and TNG
pieces and attached to their respective files.  Thus, the Movie List of
Lists is no longer supported. ]
