   _INTRODUCTION_:
   
   When I started this project, I had no idea how big it would get. I
   figured that I would just use a few of my reference books on naval
   ships so that people on the Netnews group rec.arts.startrek.misc would
   ask fewer uninformed questions about naval history. I used to post it
   regularly to that newsgroup, until Joe Creighton offered to put it on
   his "Star Trek Archive" web site. (April 1995) The hit rate astonished
   me! People were really reading this stuff! Anyhow, people started
   e-mailing me with additional information, suggestions for
   improvements, etc. It got to be a bit overwhelming. Now I'm finding
   that it's not just _Star Trek_ fans who are interested. I'm now
   finding links to this site on real naval history sites! I suppose I
   should point out to any legitimate naval historians out there that
   this was originally designed for fans of the various _Star Trek_
   television series, and so references to future history (23rd & 24th
   centuries) and an obscure incedent aboard CVN-65 in 1986 involving one
   Pavel Chekov are of course, fiction. I was also a bit sloppier about
   references than I should have been. When I started this, I was doing
   it for a (then) small community of Star Trek fans on the Internet, and
   I wasn't really planning on it being an academic work with footnotes
   and references. Some things got lost in the shuffle, and probably a
   few errors have crept in during transcription. Nevertheless, I've
   tried to at least list my sources, and thank those who have
   contributed. Thanks for reading!

       American Naval Fighting Ships is available on-line.
          + Displacement: 70 tons

       Formerly HMS _George_, a British supply ship. Captured from Great
       Britain 18 May, 1775 at St. Johns, Quebec on the Richelieu River
       by Col. Benedict Arnold et. al. Armed for use on Lake Champlain,
       renamed _Enterprise_. They took her to Crown Point, where the
       inland waters were under the command of General Schuyler. She was
       then given to Captain Dickinson for command.
       _28 August 1775_: with other vessels, embarked 1000 troops for
       capture of St Johns, Montreal, and Quebec. August 27, 1775, with
       more than 1,000 troops, she helps capture St.Johns, Montreal and
       besieged Quebec. They are forced to retreat in the Spring of 1776
       when more British Troops come.
       _4 September 1776_: American forces were readied to engage the
       British forces. _Enterprise_ and 2 schooners, eight gondolas and 4
       galleons set out under the strategy of Brigadier-General Arnold.
       _11-13 October 1776_: Battle of Valcour Island (on Lake Champlain,
       near Plattsburg, NY) Tactical defeat for Americans, though
       strategic victory. British invasion disrupted. _Enterprise_ was
       one of only five ships to escape.
          + 11 October 1776
               o 11:00am, the fleet met the British in battle.
               o 12:15pm, the fight was "very warm".
               o 5:00pm, the fight was called for the night. 60 Americans
                 were killed.
               o 7:00pm, the _Enterprise_ and the rest of the fleet
                 return to Crown Point, since 70% of the ammunition was
                 spent.
          + 12 October 1776, by morning they reached Schuyler's island.
               o 2:00pm, weighed anchor, and continued on.
               o 6:00pm, reached within 28 miles of Crown Point. All
                 night long British vessels pursued.
          + 13 October 1776, British vessels engaged the _Enterprise_ and
            American forces near Split Rock. The second battled ensued,
            leaving the fleet in shambles. _Enterprise_, two schooners
            and one gondola hastily retreated.
          + 14 October 1776, Enterprise reaches Ft. Ticonderoga at
            4:00am.
       _26 October 1776_: a battle took place between British and
       American vessels near Plattsburg, New York.
       _7 July 1777_: Battle of Lake Champlain
       The vessel was defeated and ran aground. She and five other
       vessels were helping in the evacution of Ticonderoga. The
       _Enterprise_ was then burned at Skenesboro.
       While the ship was lost, the battle of Valcour Island delayed the
       British advance by almost a year, which allowed the Americans time
       to raise and train an army. The ship was destroyed during the
       British advance toward Saratoga. On October 17, 1777, the American
       army under Gen. Horatio Gates, decisively defeated the British at
       the Battle of Saratoga. "This victory was a primary factor in
       bringing about the alliance with France and bringing the powerful
       French Navy to the aid of the colonies." _Dictionary of American
       Naval Fighting Ships, pg. 355_

       Known as "Lucky little Enterprise". The [66]full entry for this
       ship from the [67]Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships is

   12. 1861 Balloon (USA)
       During the American Civil War, there was a United States Balloon
       Corps, which used a balloon named _Enterprise_. Apparently, the
       Union Army made some use of these balloons until the Balloon Corps
       was disbanded in August 1863. I hope to investigate this further.
       _17 June 1861_: Thaddeus Lowe demonstrates _Enterprise_ at
       Columbia Armory, Washington DC. The balloon ascends to 500 feet,
       and transmits a telegraph to Abraham Lincoln.

       The first composite ironclad. (wooden construction with iron
       armor) While some have classified this ship as a "lightweight
       battleship", I tend to think of her as a modified sloop-of-war.
       She was MUCH smaller than contemporary battleships.
       Served in the Mediterranean.

               o 10:26 AM: American SBD dive bombers from the USS
                 _Enterprise_ attack heavy carriers _Kaga_ and _Akagi_.
                 Caught with planes refueling and rearming on their
                 decks, the Japanese carriers were set afire, and their
                 offensive power was destroyed. SBD dive bombers from the
                 USS _Yorktown_ (CV-5) seriously damage light carrier
                 _Soryu_. _Soryu_ is quickly sunk by submarine USS

               o 9:00 AM: _Hiryu_, too badly damaged to be saved,
                 scuttles.
          + 6 June 1942
               o 6:00 AM: _Yorktown_, sunk by submarine _I-168_.
       _NOTE_: Contrary to Okuda's entry for _Repulse_ in the first
       edition of [112]"The Star Trek Encyclopedia", HMS _Repulse_ was
       _not_ involved in this action. HMS _Repulse_ was sunk 10 December
       1941 by Japanese torpedo bombers near Singapore. More recent
       editions seem to have corrected this error.

       by three bombs, killing 44, wounding 75, but kept fighting.
       [114][10]
       USS _Enterprise_ might easily have been sunk had it not been for
       the anti-aircraft gunfire of the battleship USS _South Dakota_
       (BB-57), which shot down a record 26 aircraft that day, a record
       which still stands.
       _30 October-11 November 1942_: Partial repairs at Noumea, New
       Caledonia

       _6 June 1944_: Left Majuro for the Marianas.
       _19-20 June 1944_: First Battle of the Phillipine Sea, AKA The
       Great Marianas Turkey Shoot. Approximately 400 Japanese aircraft
       destroyed by planes from the Enterprise and other US carriers, and
       by anti-aircraft guns from other US ships.
       _24-26 October 1944_: Battle of Leyte Gulf. This was the largest
       naval battle of all time. It was so large, that historians usually
       subdivide it into several smaller battles, such as the Battle off
       Cape Engano, the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, the Battle off Samar,
       the Battle of the Surigao Strait, etc. USS _Enterprise_ was part
       of the Third Fleet's famous Task Force 38, specifically TG 38.4.
          + 24 October 1944: Battle of the Sulu Sea. Planes from
            Enterprise spot Japanese southern force, attack battleship
            _Fuso_. [117][13]
          + 24 October 1944: Battle of the Sibuyan Sea. Planes from the
            USS _Enterprise_, the USS _Essex_ (CV-9), the USS _Intrepid_
            (CV-11), USS _Cabot_ (CVL-28), and USS _Franklin_ (CV-13)
            sink the battleship _Musashi_. Heavy cruiser _Myoko_ damaged.
            [118][14]
          + 25 October 1944: Battle off Cape Engano. Partially
            responsible for sinking carrier _Zuikaku_ and light carrier
            _Zuiho_.
       6 December 1944: Returned to Pearl Harbor. [119][15]
       _7-12 April 1945 _: Okinawa Campaign.
          + _7 April 1945_: Japanese battleship _Yamato_ sinks.
            _Editor's Note:_ For many years, I had believed that the
            Enterprise had been involved in this action. I thought that I
            had seen it in one of my books. After searching all of my
            references, I can find no evidence that CV-6 was involved in
            the sinking of the _Yamato_. Best evidence suggests that the
            _Yamato_ was sunk by aircraft from the carriers USS _Essex_
            (CV-9), USS _Yorktown_ (CV-10), USS _Hornet_ (CV-12), USS
            _Bunker Hill_ (CV-17), and USS _Bennington_ (CV-20).

       Enterprise, the first Space Shuttle Orbiter, was originally to be
       named Constitution (in honor of the U.S. Bicentennial). However,
       viewers of the popular TV Science Fiction show _Star Trek_ started
       a write-in campaign urging the White House to rename the vehicle
       Enterprise. While OV-101 never made it into space, she was a
       valuable testbed for the space shuttle program.

       is a Constitution class. That makes it "canon".

   34. Other Enterprises:
       There seems to have been a British ship named Enterprize which was
       sent off to find the new passage to the Orient in 1616. She
       succeeded, but was destroyed in a hurricane near India. There is
       little data on her.
       Apparently, there was a British ship named Enterprize that
       explored the Yarra River in Australia around 1820. I have no
       additional data.
       There has been a Malaysian supply ship named Enterprise since the
       late 1980s. I'm looking for data on her. Apparently, she is very
       small.
       There is also currently a schooner named Enterprise, built 1947.
       Again, I'm trying to get more information.
       A group in Washington DC is attempting to create a replica of the
       [201]1799-1823 Enterprise, to be called "Spirit of Enterprize".
       (sic) [202]Details are available on their website.
       There was a picture of an earlier space ship named Enterprise in
       Star Trek: TMP. There was no information about this ship in the
       movie, but the [203]Star Trek Space Flight Chronology lists what
       is apparently this same ship, as a Declaration class, 2123-2165
       AD, While this ship's connection to "canon" is tenuous at best,
       (and, as of 2001, has been contradicted by the new series
       "Enterprise") the statistics are reproduced here:
          + Length - 300m
          + Diameter - 210m
          + Living section width - 28.7m
          + Mass - 52.7 million kg
          + Ship's Compliment:
          + Crew and Service Personnel - 100
          + Passenger Capacity - 850
          + Total ship's compliment - 950
          + Performance:
          + Range - Standard = 350 light years Maximum= 1,200 light years
          + Cruising Speed - Warp 3.2 (32.8c)
          + Voyage duration - Standard 3 months Maximum 2.5 years
          + Systems:
          + Navigation - Celestial Warp Reader
          + Communication - Subspace Radio
          + Recreation - Null-grav gymnasium 5 dining rooms 3 theaters 3
            nightclubs Forward and Rear stellar observatories
          + Life support: Gravity - .2 -1.2 g Atmosphere - 20% Oxygen,
            11% humidity
          + Sustenance duration - Up to 40 years if outfitted for
            long-duration exploration
          + Engineering and Science
               o Advanced 2nd Generation Warp Drive
               o Fuel: 10:1 matter to antimatter
               o Separated engine and living sections for improved
                 efficiency
          + Improvements and innovations:
               o First class of ship equipped with sub-space radio
               o Most popular passenger carrier of its time
       This original Enterprise was the first stellar spaceliner built
       specifically for the major Federation space lanes (such as Earth -
       Alpha Centauri). The travel demand that blossomed in the 22nd
       century resulted in 957 of these Declaration class ships being
       commissioned.

   _Standards for inclusion on the list_
   
   There were of course, many other ships named Enterprise, or
   Enterprize, which are not listed here. No doubt, numerous yachts and
   other privately owned vessels were given this name, or some variant
   thereof. I cannot possibly list all of them here. I used to use the
   standard that only ships commissioned into a navy (or Starfleet) could
   get onto the list, but that would eliminate some of the blimps, and
   the America's Cup yachts, all of which are historically significant.
   The standard I use now is a bit vague. Commissioned warships named
   Enterprise are included, as are any interesting (to me) or
   historically significant ships named Enterprise.

  _Notes on "Canonicity" of Sources: _
  
   When discussing technical and "historical" matters pertaining to the
   various _Star Trek_ series, fans often use the term "canon". A piece
   of information is considered "canon" if it was mentioned or shown on
   one of the television series (notable exception: the 1973-74 animated
   TV series is not considered "canon", despite the fact that some
   episodes were quite well done.) or in one of the movies. In general,
   none of the novels are "canon" sources, nor are any of the various
   technical books that have been published over the years. Supposedly,
   these standards were laid down by Gene Roddenberry himself, although
   I've never seen any solid documentation of this.
   
   Strictly speaking, none of my sources are canon, however some are
   better than others.
   
   My own historical sources on 20th century and earlier Enterprises are
   quite reliable. I have had to rely on some other people on the for
   information on some of the ships. For example, all of the information
   on the first two blimps came from Thomas Kozak. He cited his sources,
   but I haven't had time to go to the library to look up all his
   references.
   
   For the various _Star Trek_ Enterprises, none of the sources are
   "canon", but some are close. For example, the length of the original
   NCC-1701 was never mentioned in the original series, but Roddenberry &
   Whitfield wrote 947 feet in "The Making of Star Trek" and every other
   source since has quoted that figure. Since Roddenberry was the creator
   and executive producer of _Star Trek_, nobody will argue with his
   numbers! Similary, it's hard to argue with Rick Sternbach's numbers on
   NCC-1701E.
     * [209]Parkes and [210]Friedman are considered authoritative. Don't
       argue with them unless you've got REALLY good evidence.
     * [211]Jane's Fighting Ships is considered definitive. (even when
       they're wrong, they're definitively wrong!) Since 1898, the annual
       edition of Jane's Fighting Ships has been one of the greatest
       sources for information on modern warships. They make mistakes
       from time to time, but that's the price they pay for trying to be
       up-to-date on often secret ship projects.
     * I also hold [212]Terzibaschitsch in high regard for what he does.
       He does not go into great detail on the origin of the design, but
       he provides superb information on the exact fitting of the ship at
       different times, well organized comparison tables, plus some
       career information.
     * I have also found [213]Jentschura, Jung & Mickel to be reliable,
       and their book provided much useful information on Japanese ships
       sunk by CV-6.
     * If nothing else, the [214]Dictionary of American Naval Fighting
       Ships is official, (if somewhat dated) as it is a publication of
       the U.S. Navy.
     * I regard [215]"The Making of Star Trek", [216]"The Star Trek
       Encyclopedia" and [217]"Star Trek: TNG Technical Manual" as nearly
       canon, since they were written by the producers. Some statistics
       on Enterprise B, C, and D had to be taken from drawings in the
       Encyclopedia, so other than length, my numbers may be suspect on
       these ships.
     * The [218]"Star Fleet Technical Manual" by Franz Joseph was mostly
       well researched, (there are some errors) and was once considered
       nearly canon, but it has been contradicted many times since its
       publication over 20 years ago. Alas, data in this book must now be
       regarded as suspect. Still, the diagrams and statistics for the
       original NCC-1701 are helpful, and are consistent with other
       sources.
     * [219]"Ships of the Star Fleet" is sort of a late 23rd century
       version of "Jane's Fighting Ships", or perhaps "Ships and Aircraft
       of the U.S. Fleet". While it is quite interesting, and quite well
       produced, much of the information has no support in canon, and
       some of it has been contradicted in canon sources since its
       publication in 1987. I used this only for a few details on
       NCC-1701 and NCC-1701A. The drawings are marvelous, though.
       
   _Notes on Distribution and re-use of this information:_
   
   Feel free to copy and distribute this, as long as you don't try to
   make any money off of it. All I ask is that you give me appropriate
   credit for compiling this list. It would be really nice if you
   credited my contributors too.
   
   _Usual Disclaimer:_
   
   AT&T (my employer) had nothing to do with this list, so don't even
   think about suing them. I am solely responsible for the content of the
   list. I wrote it at home on my own PC on my own time. So there.
