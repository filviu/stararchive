Welcome to the Star Trek ASCII Art Archive

All pictures are by Joshua Bell, unless marked with an asterisk (*) - those 
files should be credited internally. Any corrections to the attributions would 
be welcomed. 

From the Jargon File (aka Hacker's Dictionary): 
    ASCII art: n. The fine art of drawing diagrams using the ASCII character set 
    (mainly `|', `-', `/', `\', and `+'). Also known as `character graphics' or 
    `ASCII graphics' 

This means that the images in this archive are not GIFs, JPEGs, AutoCad 
blueprints, Lightwave renderings, or anything else of that nature. They're 
comprised entirely of characters you can type on a keyboard. Please stop sending
me email complaining that the images are made out of little dashes. It's an art 
form, albeit a strange one.
